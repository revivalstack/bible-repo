"How long will you speak these things, And the words of your mouth be like a strong wind? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Does God subvert judgment? Or does the Almighty pervert justice? 

<sup>4</sup> 
If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression. 

<sup>5</sup> 
If you would earnestly seek God And make your supplication to the Almighty, 

<sup>6</sup> 
If you were pure and upright, Surely now He would awake for you, And prosper your rightful dwelling place.

"For inquire, please, of the former age, And consider the things discovered by their fathers;

<sup>20</sup> 
Behold, God will not cast away the blameless, Nor will He uphold the evildoers. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He will yet fill your mouth with laughing, And your lips with rejoicing. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing."
