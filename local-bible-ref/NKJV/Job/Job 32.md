<sup>1</sup> 
So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job. 

<sup>5</sup> 
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused. 

<sup>6</sup> 
So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are very old; Therefore I was afraid, And dared not declare my opinion to you. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I said, 'Age should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.' 

<sup>8</sup> 
But there is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Great men are not always wise, Nor do the aged always understand justice. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"Therefore I say, 'Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.' 

<sup>11</sup> 
Indeed I waited for your words, I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I paid close attention to you; And surely not one of you convinced Job, Or answered his words-- 

<sup>13</sup> 
Lest you say, 'We have found wisdom'; God will vanquish him, not man. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Now he has not directed his words against me; So I will not answer him with your words. 

<sup>15</sup> 
"They are dismayed and answer no more; Words escape them. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And I have waited, because they did not speak, Because they stood still and answered no more. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I also will answer my part, I too will declare my opinion. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For I am full of words; The spirit within me compels me. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent; It is ready to burst like new wineskins. 

<sup>20</sup> 
I will speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone; Nor let me flatter any man. 

<sup>22</sup> 
For I do not know how to flatter, Else my Maker would soon take me away.
