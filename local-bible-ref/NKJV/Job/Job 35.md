Moreover Elihu answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Do you think this is right? Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'? 

<sup>3</sup> 
For you say, 'What advantage will it be to You? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?' 

<sup>4</sup> 
"I will answer you, And your companions with you. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Look to the heavens and see; And behold the clouds-- They are higher than you. 

<sup>6</sup> 
If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him? 

<sup>7</sup> 
If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Your wickedness affects a man such as you, And your righteousness a son of man. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the night, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?' 

<sup>12</sup> 
There they cry out, but He does not answer, Because of the pride of evil men. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Surely God will not listen to empty talk, Nor will the Almighty regard it. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Although you say you do not see Him, Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And now, because He has not punished in His anger, Nor taken much notice of folly, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain; He multiplies words without knowledge."
