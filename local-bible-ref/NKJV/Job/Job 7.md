"Is there not a time of hard service for man on earth? Are not his days also like the days of a hired man? 

<sup>2</sup> 
Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade, And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages, 

<sup>3</sup> 
So I have been allotted months of futility, And wearisome nights have been appointed to me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, And the night be ended?' For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn. 

<sup>5</sup> 
My flesh is caked with worms and dust, My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Oh, remember that my life is a breath! My eye will never again see good. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The eye of him who sees me will see me no more; While your eyes are upon me, I shall no longer be. 

<sup>9</sup> 
As the cloud disappears and vanishes away, So he who goes down to the grave does not come up. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He shall never return to his house, Nor shall his place know him anymore. 

<sup>11</sup> 
"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Am I a sea, or a sea serpent, That You set a guard over me? 

<sup>13</sup> 
When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint,' 

<sup>14</sup> 
Then You scare me with dreams And terrify me with visions, 

<sup>15</sup> 
So that my soul chooses strangling And death rather than my body. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, For my days are but a breath. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"What is man, that You should exalt him, That You should set Your heart on him, 

<sup>18</sup> 
That You should visit him every morning, And test him every moment? 

<sup>19</sup> 
How long? Will You not look away from me, And let me alone till I swallow my saliva? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Have I sinned? What have I done to You, O watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, So that I am a burden to myself? 

<sup>21</sup> 
Why then do You not pardon my transgression, And take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, And You will seek me diligently, But I will no longer be."
