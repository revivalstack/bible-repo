Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Can a man be profitable to God, Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless? 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you, And enters into judgment with you? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Is not your wickedness great, And your iniquity without end? 

<sup>6</sup> 
For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason, And stripped the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You have not given the weary water to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But the mighty man possessed the land, And the honorable man dwelt in it. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You have sent widows away empty, And the strength of the fatherless was crushed. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore snares are all around you, And sudden fear troubles you, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Or darkness so that you cannot see; And an abundance of water covers you. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Is not God in the height of heaven? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are! 

<sup>13</sup> 
And you say, 'What does God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness? 

<sup>14</sup> 
Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, And He walks above the circle of heaven.' 

<sup>15</sup> 
Will you keep to the old way Which wicked men have trod, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Who were cut down before their time, Whose foundations were swept away by a flood? 

<sup>17</sup> 
They said to God, 'Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?' 

<sup>18</sup> 
Yet He filled their houses with good things; But the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>19</sup> 
"The righteous see it and are glad, And the innocent laugh at them: 

<sup>20</sup> 
'Surely our adversaries are cut down, And the fire consumes their remnant.' 

<sup>21</sup> 
"Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace; Thereby good will come to you. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Receive, please, instruction from His mouth, And lay up His words in your heart. 

<sup>23</sup> 
If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up; You will remove iniquity far from your tents. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Then you will lay your gold in the dust, And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Yes, the Almighty will be your gold And your precious silver; 

<sup>26</sup> 
For then you will have your delight in the Almighty, And lift up your face to God. 

<sup>27</sup> 
You will make your prayer to Him, He will hear you, And you will pay your vows. 

<sup>28</sup> 
You will also declare a thing, And it will be established for you; So light will shine on your ways. 

<sup>29</sup> 
When they cast you down, and you say, 'Exaltation will come!' Then He will save the humble person. 

<sup>30</sup> 
He will even deliver one who is not innocent; Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands."
