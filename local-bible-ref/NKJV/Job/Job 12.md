Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"No doubt you are the people, And wisdom will die with you! 

<sup>3</sup> 
But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Indeed, who does not know such things as these? 

<sup>4</sup> 
"I am one mocked by his friends, Who called on God, and He answered him, The just and blameless who is ridiculed. 

<sup>5</sup> 
A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease; It is made ready for those whose feet slip. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The tents of robbers prosper, And those who provoke God are secure-- In what God provides by His hand. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; And the birds of the air, and they will tell you; 

<sup>8</sup> 
Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; And the fish of the sea will explain to you. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Who among all these does not know That the hand of the Lord has done this, 

<sup>10</sup> 
In whose hand is the life of every living thing, And the breath of all mankind? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Does not the ear test words And the mouth taste its food? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Wisdom is with aged men, And with length of days, understanding. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"With Him are wisdom and strength, He has counsel and understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> 
If He breaks a thing down, it cannot be rebuilt; If He imprisons a man, there can be no release. 

<sup>15</sup> 
If He withholds the waters, they dry up; If He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
With Him are strength and prudence. The deceived and the deceiver are His. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He leads counselors away plundered, And makes fools of the judges. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He loosens the bonds of kings, And binds their waist with a belt. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He leads princes away plundered, And overthrows the mighty. 

<sup>20</sup> 
He deprives the trusted ones of speech, And takes away the discernment of the elders. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He pours contempt on princes, And disarms the mighty. 

<sup>22</sup> 
He uncovers deep things out of darkness, And brings the shadow of death to light. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He makes nations great, and destroys them; He enlarges nations, and guides them. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth, And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness. 

<sup>25</sup> 
They grope in the dark without light, And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.
