"I have made a covenant with my eyes; Why then should I look upon a young woman? 

<sup>2</sup> 
For what is the allotment of God from above, And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Is it not destruction for the wicked, And disaster for the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Does He not see my ways, And count all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> 
"If I have walked with falsehood, Or if my foot has hastened to deceit, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let me be weighed on honest scales, That God may know my integrity. 

<sup>7</sup> 
If my step has turned from the way, Or my heart walked after my eyes, Or if any spot adheres to my hands, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Then let me sow, and another eat; Yes, let my harvest be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"If my heart has been enticed by a woman, Or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door, 

<sup>10</sup> 
Then let my wife grind for another, And let others bow down over her. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For that would be wickedness; Yes, it would be iniquity deserving of judgment. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction, And would root out all my increase. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant When they complained against me, 

<sup>14</sup> 
What then shall I do when God rises up? When He punishes, how shall I answer Him? 

<sup>15</sup> 
Did not He who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same One fashion us in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> 
"If I have kept the poor from their desire, Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Or eaten my morsel by myself, So that the fatherless could not eat of it 

<sup>18</sup> 
(But from my youth I reared him as a father, And from my mother's womb I guided the widow); 

<sup>19</sup> 
If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, Or any poor man without covering; 

<sup>20</sup> 
If his heart has not blessed me, And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 

<sup>21</sup> 
If I have raised my hand against the fatherless, When I saw I had help in the gate; 

<sup>22</sup> 
Then let my arm fall from my shoulder, Let my arm be torn from the socket. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For destruction from God is a terror to me, And because of His magnificence I cannot endure. 

<sup>24</sup> 
"If I have made gold my hope, Or said to fine gold, 'You are my confidence'; 

<sup>25</sup> 
If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gained much; 

<sup>26</sup> 
If I have observed the sun when it shines, Or the moon moving in brightness, 

<sup>27</sup> 
So that my heart has been secretly enticed, And my mouth has kissed my hand; 

<sup>28</sup> 
This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment, For I would have denied God who is above. 

<sup>29</sup> 
"If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, Or lifted myself up when evil found him 

<sup>30</sup> 
(Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin By asking for a curse on his soul); 

<sup>31</sup> 
If the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?' 

<sup>32</sup> 
(But no sojourner had to lodge in the street, For I have opened my doors to the traveler); 

<sup>33</sup> 
If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, By hiding my iniquity in my bosom, 

<sup>34</sup> 
Because I feared the great multitude, And dreaded the contempt of families, So that I kept silence And did not go out of the door-- 

<sup>35</sup> 
Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my mark. Oh, that the Almighty would answer me, That my Prosecutor had written a book! 

<sup>36</sup> 
Surely I would carry it on my shoulder, And bind it on me like a crown; 

<sup>37</sup> 
I would declare to Him the number of my steps; Like a prince I would approach Him. 

<sup>38</sup> 
"If my land cries out against me, And its furrows weep together; 

<sup>39</sup> 
If I have eaten its fruit without money, Or caused its owners to lose their lives; 

<sup>40</sup> 
Then let thistles grow instead of wheat, And weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
