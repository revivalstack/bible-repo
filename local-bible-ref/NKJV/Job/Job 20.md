Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer, Because of the turmoil within me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me, And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer. 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Do you not know this of old, Since man was placed on earth, 

<sup>5</sup> 
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment? 

<sup>6</sup> 
Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens, And his head reaches to the clouds, 

<sup>7</sup> 
Yet he will perish forever like his own refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 

<sup>8</sup> 
He will fly away like a dream, and not be found; Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The eye that saw him will see him no more, Nor will his place behold him anymore. 

<sup>10</sup> 
His children will seek the favor of the poor, And his hands will restore his wealth. 

<sup>11</sup> 
His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it will lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Though evil is sweet in his mouth, And he hides it under his tongue, 

<sup>13</sup> 
Though he spares it and does not forsake it, But still keeps it in his mouth, 

<sup>14</sup> 
Yet his food in his stomach turns sour; It becomes cobra venom within him. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He swallows down riches And vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He will suck the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue will slay him. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He will not see the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and cream. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He will restore that for which he labored, And will not swallow it down; From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment. 

<sup>19</sup> 
For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor, He has violently seized a house which he did not build. 

<sup>20</sup> 
"Because he knows no quietness in his heart, He will not save anything he desires. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Nothing is left for him to eat; Therefore his well-being will not last. 

<sup>22</sup> 
In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress; Every hand of misery will come against him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
When he is about to fill his stomach, God will cast on him the fury of His wrath, And will rain it on him while he is eating. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He will flee from the iron weapon; A bronze bow will pierce him through. 

<sup>25</sup> 
It is drawn, and comes out of the body; Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors come upon him; 

<sup>26</sup> 
Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. An unfanned fire will consume him; It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent. 

<sup>27</sup> 
The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> 
The increase of his house will depart, And his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> 
This is the portion from God for a wicked man, The heritage appointed to him by God."
