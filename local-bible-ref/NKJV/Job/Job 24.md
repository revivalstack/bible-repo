"Since times are not hidden from the Almighty, Why do those who know Him see not His days? 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Some remove landmarks; They seize flocks violently and feed on them; 

<sup>3</sup> 
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; They take the widow's ox as a pledge. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They push the needy off the road; All the poor of the land are forced to hide. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, They go out to their work, searching for food. The wilderness yields food for them and for their children. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They gather their fodder in the field And glean in the vineyard of the wicked. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They spend the night naked, without clothing, And have no covering in the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And huddle around the rock for want of shelter. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"Some snatch the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge from the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> 
They cause the poor to go naked, without clothing; And they take away the sheaves from the hungry. 

<sup>11</sup> 
They press out oil within their walls, And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The dying groan in the city, And the souls of the wounded cry out; Yet God does not charge them with wrong. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"There are those who rebel against the light; They do not know its ways Nor abide in its paths. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The murderer rises with the light; He kills the poor and needy; And in the night he is like a thief. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, Saying, 'No eye will see me'; And he disguises his face. 

<sup>16</sup> 
In the dark they break into houses Which they marked for themselves in the daytime; They do not know the light. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death; If someone recognizes them, They are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 

<sup>18</sup> 
"They should be swift on the face of the waters, Their portion should be cursed in the earth, So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards. 

<sup>19</sup> 
As drought and heat consume the snow waters, So the grave consumes those who have sinned. 

<sup>20</sup> 
The womb should forget him, The worm should feed sweetly on him; He should be remembered no more, And wickedness should be broken like a tree. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For he preys on the barren who do not bear, And does no good for the widow. 

<sup>22</sup> 
"But God draws the mighty away with His power; He rises up, but no man is sure of life. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He gives them security, and they rely on it; Yet His eyes are on their ways. 

<sup>24</sup> 
They are exalted for a little while, Then they are gone. They are brought low; They are taken out of the way like all others; They dry out like the heads of grain. 

<sup>25</sup> 
"Now if it is not so, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech worth nothing?"
