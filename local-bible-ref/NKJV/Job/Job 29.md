Job further continued his discourse, and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Oh, that I were as in months past, As in the days when God watched over me; 

<sup>3</sup> 
When His lamp shone upon my head, And when by His light I walked through darkness; 

<sup>4</sup> 
Just as I was in the days of my prime, When the friendly counsel of God was over my tent; 

<sup>5</sup> 
When the Almighty was yet with me, When my children were around me; 

<sup>6</sup> 
When my steps were bathed with cream, And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me! 

<sup>7</sup> 
"When I went out to the gate by the city, When I took my seat in the open square, 

<sup>8</sup> 
The young men saw me and hid, And the aged arose and stood; 

<sup>9</sup> 
The princes refrained from talking, And put their hand on their mouth; 

<sup>10</sup> 
The voice of nobles was hushed, And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. 

<sup>11</sup> 
When the ear heard, then it blessed me, And when the eye saw, then it approved me; 

<sup>12</sup> 
Because I delivered the poor who cried out, The fatherless and the one who had no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The blessing of a perishing man came upon me, And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; My justice was like a robe and a turban. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I was eyes to the blind, And I was feet to the lame. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I was a father to the poor, And I searched out the case that I did not know. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I broke the fangs of the wicked, And plucked the victim from his teeth. 

<sup>18</sup> 
"Then I said, 'I shall die in my nest, And multiply my days as the sand. 

<sup>19</sup> 
My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lies all night on my branch. 

<sup>20</sup> 
My glory is fresh within me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.' 

<sup>21</sup> 
"Men listened to me and waited, And kept silence for my counsel. 

<sup>22</sup> 
After my words they did not speak again, And my speech settled on them as dew. 

<sup>23</sup> 
They waited for me as for the rain, And they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain. 

<sup>24</sup> 
If I mocked at them, they did not believe it, And the light of my countenance they did not cast down. 

<sup>25</sup> 
I chose the way for them, and sat as chief; So I dwelt as a king in the army, As one who comforts mourners.
