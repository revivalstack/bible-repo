"Man who is born of woman Is of few days and full of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He comes forth like a flower and fades away; He flees like a shadow and does not continue. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And do You open Your eyes on such a one, And bring me to judgment with Yourself? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one! 

<sup>5</sup> 
Since his days are determined, The number of his months is with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Look away from him that he may rest, Till like a hired man he finishes his day. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender shoots will not cease. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Though its root may grow old in the earth, And its stump may die in the ground, 

<sup>9</sup> 
Yet at the scent of water it will bud And bring forth branches like a plant. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But man dies and is laid away; Indeed he breathes his last And where is he? 

<sup>11</sup> 
As water disappears from the sea, And a river becomes parched and dries up, 

<sup>12</sup> 
So man lies down and does not rise. Till the heavens are no more, They will not awake Nor be roused from their sleep. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"Oh, that You would hide me in the grave, That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me! 

<sup>14</sup> 
If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, Till my change comes. 

<sup>15</sup> 
You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall desire the work of Your hands. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For now You number my steps, But do not watch over my sin. 

<sup>17</sup> 
My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And You cover my iniquity. 

<sup>18</sup> 
"But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, And as a rock is moved from its place; 

<sup>19</sup> 
As water wears away stones, And as torrents wash away the soil of the earth; So You destroy the hope of man. 

<sup>20</sup> 
You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away. 

<sup>21</sup> 
His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; They are brought low, and he does not perceive it. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But his flesh will be in pain over it, And his soul will mourn over it."
