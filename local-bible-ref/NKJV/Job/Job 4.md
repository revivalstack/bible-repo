Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Surely you have instructed many, And you have strengthened weak hands. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, And you have strengthened the feeble knees; 

<sup>5</sup> 
But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; It touches you, and you are troubled. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope? 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Even as I have seen, Those who plow iniquity And sow trouble reap the same. 

<sup>9</sup> 
By the blast of God they perish, And by the breath of His anger they are consumed. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The roaring of the lion, The voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the cubs of the lioness are scattered. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Now a word was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it. 

<sup>13</sup> 
In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men, 

<sup>14</sup> 
Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones shake. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair on my body stood up. 

<sup>16</sup> 
It stood still, But I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; There was silence; Then I heard a voice saying: 

<sup>17</sup> 
'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker? 

<sup>18</sup> 
If He puts no trust in His servants, If He charges His angels with error, 

<sup>19</sup> 
How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before a moth? 

<sup>20</sup> 
They are broken in pieces from morning till evening; They perish forever, with no one regarding. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Does not their own excellence go away? They die, even without wisdom.'
