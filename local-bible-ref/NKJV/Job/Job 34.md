Elihu further answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Hear my words, you wise men; Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the ear tests words As the palate tastes food. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Let us choose justice for ourselves; Let us know among ourselves what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> 
"For Job has said, 'I am righteous, But God has taken away my justice; 

<sup>6</sup> 
Should I lie concerning my right? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' 

<sup>7</sup> 
What man is like Job, Who drinks scorn like water, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, And walks with wicked men? 

<sup>9</sup> 
For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing That he should delight in God.' 

<sup>10</sup> 
"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Almighty to commit iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For He repays man according to his work, And makes man to find a reward according to his way. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Surely God will never do wickedly, Nor will the Almighty pervert justice. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Who gave Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed Him over the whole world? 

<sup>14</sup> 
If He should set His heart on it, If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath, 

<sup>15</sup> 
All flesh would perish together, And man would return to dust. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"If you have understanding, hear this; Listen to the sound of my words: 

<sup>17</sup> 
Should one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn Him who is most just? 

<sup>18</sup> 
Is it fitting to say to a king, 'You are worthless,' And to nobles, 'You are wicked'? 

<sup>19</sup> 
Yet He is not partial to princes, Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; For they are all the work of His hands. 

<sup>20</sup> 
In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; The people are shaken and pass away; The mighty are taken away without a hand. 

<sup>21</sup> 
"For His eyes are on the ways of man, And He sees all his steps. 

<sup>22</sup> 
There is no darkness nor shadow of death Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For He need not further consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry, And sets others in their place. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Therefore He knows their works; He overthrows them in the night, And they are crushed. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others, 

<sup>27</sup> 
Because they turned back from Him, And would not consider any of His ways, 

<sup>28</sup> 
So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him; For He hears the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>29</sup> 
When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble? And when He hides His face, who then can see Him, Whether it is against a nation or a man alone?-- 

<sup>30</sup> 
That the hypocrite should not reign, Lest the people be ensnared. 

<sup>31</sup> 
"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne chastening; I will offend no more; 

<sup>32</sup> 
Teach me what I do not see; If I have done iniquity, I will do no more'? 

<sup>33</sup> 
Should He repay it according to your terms, Just because you disavow it? You must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what you know. 

<sup>34</sup> 
"Men of understanding say to me, Wise men who listen to me: 

<sup>35</sup> 
'Job speaks without knowledge, His words are without wisdom.' 

<sup>36</sup> 
Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, Because his answers are like those of wicked men! 

<sup>37</sup> 
For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God."
