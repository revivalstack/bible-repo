"At this also my heart trembles, And leaps from its place. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Hear attentively the thunder of His voice, And the rumbling that comes from His mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He sends it forth under the whole heaven, His lightning to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
After it a voice roars; He thunders with His majestic voice, And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard. 

<sup>5</sup> 
God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth'; Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He seals the hand of every man, That all men may know His work. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The beasts go into dens, And remain in their lairs. 

<sup>9</sup> 
From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind, And cold from the scattering winds of the north. 

<sup>10</sup> 
By the breath of God ice is given, And the broad waters are frozen. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds; He scatters His bright clouds. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance, That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He causes it to come, Whether for correction, Or for His land, Or for mercy. 

<sup>14</sup> 
"Listen to this, O Job; Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Do you know when God dispatches them, And causes the light of His cloud to shine? 

<sup>16</sup> 
Do you know how the clouds are balanced, Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Why are your garments hot, When He quiets the earth by the south wind? 

<sup>18</sup> 
With Him, have you spread out the skies, Strong as a cast metal mirror? 

<sup>19</sup> 
"Teach us what we should say to Him, For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Should He be told that I wish to speak? If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies, When the wind has passed and cleared them. 

<sup>22</sup> 
He comes from the north as golden splendor; With God is awesome majesty. 

<sup>23</sup> 
As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him; He is excellent in power, In judgment and abundant justice; He does not oppress. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Therefore men fear Him; He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart."
