Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Who is this who darkens counsel By words without knowledge? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Who determined its measurements? Surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 

<sup>6</sup> 
To what were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone, 

<sup>7</sup> 
When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Or who shut in the sea with doors, When it burst forth and issued from the womb; 

<sup>9</sup> 
When I made the clouds its garment, And thick darkness its swaddling band; 

<sup>10</sup> 
When I fixed My limit for it, And set bars and doors; 

<sup>11</sup> 
When I said, 'This far you may come, but no farther, And here your proud waves must stop!' 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Have you commanded the morning since your days began, And caused the dawn to know its place, 

<sup>13</sup> 
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it? 

<sup>14</sup> 
It takes on form like clay under a seal, And stands out like a garment. 

<sup>15</sup> 
From the wicked their light is withheld, And the upraised arm is broken. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"Have you entered the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depths? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death? 

<sup>18</sup> 
Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know all this. 

<sup>19</sup> 
"Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And darkness, where is its place, 

<sup>20</sup> 
That you may take it to its territory, That you may know the paths to its home? 

<sup>21</sup> 
Do you know it, because you were born then, Or because the number of your days is great? 

<sup>22</sup> 
"Have you entered the treasury of snow, Or have you seen the treasury of hail, 

<sup>23</sup> 
Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, For the day of battle and war? 

<sup>24</sup> 
By what way is light diffused, Or the east wind scattered over the earth? 

<sup>25</sup> 
"Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water, Or a path for the thunderbolt, 

<sup>26</sup> 
To cause it to rain on a land where there is no one, A wilderness in which there is no man; 

<sup>27</sup> 
To satisfy the desolate waste, And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass? 

<sup>28</sup> 
Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? 

<sup>29</sup> 
From whose womb comes the ice? And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth? 

<sup>30</sup> 
The waters harden like stone, And the surface of the deep is frozen. 

<sup>31</sup> 
"Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the belt of Orion? 

<sup>32</sup> 
Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season? Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs? 

<sup>33</sup> 
Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you set their dominion over the earth? 

<sup>34</sup> 
"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That an abundance of water may cover you? 

<sup>35</sup> 
Can you send out lightnings, that they may go, And say to you, 'Here we are!'? 

<sup>36</sup> 
Who has put wisdom in the mind? Or who has given understanding to the heart? 

<sup>37</sup> 
Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven, 

<sup>38</sup> 
When the dust hardens in clumps, And the clods cling together? 

<sup>39</sup> 
"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 

<sup>40</sup> 
When they crouch in their dens, Or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait? 

<sup>41</sup> 
Who provides food for the raven, When its young ones cry to God, And wander about for lack of food?
