Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"I have heard many such things; Miserable comforters are you all! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Shall words of wind have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 

<sup>4</sup> 
I also could speak as you do, If your soul were in my soul's place. I could heap up words against you, And shake my head at you; 

<sup>5</sup> 
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"Though I speak, my grief is not relieved; And if I remain silent, how am I eased? 

<sup>7</sup> 
But now He has worn me out; You have made desolate all my company. 

<sup>8</sup> 
You have shriveled me up, And it is a witness against me; My leanness rises up against me And bears witness to my face. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He tears me in His wrath, and hates me; He gnashes at me with His teeth; My adversary sharpens His gaze on me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
They gape at me with their mouth, They strike me reproachfully on the cheek, They gather together against me. 

<sup>11</sup> 
God has delivered me to the ungodly, And turned me over to the hands of the wicked. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I was at ease, but He has shattered me; He also has taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces; He has set me up for His target, 

<sup>13</sup> 
His archers surround me. He pierces my heart and does not pity; He pours out my gall on the ground. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He breaks me with wound upon wound; He runs at me like a warrior. 

<sup>15</sup> 
"I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, And laid my head in the dust. 

<sup>16</sup> 
My face is flushed from weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 

<sup>17</sup> 
Although no violence is in my hands, And my prayer is pure. 

<sup>18</sup> 
"O earth, do not cover my blood, And let my cry have no resting place! 

<sup>19</sup> 
Surely even now my witness is in heaven, And my evidence is on high. 

<sup>20</sup> 
My friends scorn me; My eyes pour out tears to God. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, As a man pleads for his neighbor! 

<sup>22</sup> 
For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return.
