"Call out now; Is there anyone who will answer you? And to which of the holy ones will you turn? 

<sup>2</sup> 
For wrath kills a foolish man, And envy slays a simple one. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I have seen the foolish taking root, But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place. 

<sup>4</sup> 
His sons are far from safety, They are crushed in the gate, And there is no deliverer. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Because the hungry eat up his harvest, Taking it even from the thorns, And a snare snatches their substance. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does trouble spring from the ground; 

<sup>7</sup> 
Yet man is born to trouble, As the sparks fly upward. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"But as for me, I would seek God, And to God I would commit my cause-- 

<sup>9</sup> 
Who does great things, and unsearchable, Marvelous things without number. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He gives rain on the earth, And sends waters on the fields. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He sets on high those who are lowly, And those who mourn are lifted to safety. 

<sup>12</sup> 
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot carry out their plans. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He catches the wise in their own craftiness, And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They meet with darkness in the daytime, And grope at noontime as in the night. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But He saves the needy from the sword, From the mouth of the mighty, And from their hand. 

<sup>16</sup> 
So the poor have hope, And injustice shuts her mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects; Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For He bruises, but He binds up; He wounds, but His hands make whole. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He shall deliver you in six troubles, Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you. 

<sup>20</sup> 
In famine He shall redeem you from death, And in war from the power of the sword. 

<sup>21</sup> 
You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes. 

<sup>22</sup> 
You shall laugh at destruction and famine, And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 

<sup>24</sup> 
You shall know that your tent is in peace; You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss. 

<sup>25</sup> 
You shall also know that your descendants shall be many, And your offspring like the grass of the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> 
You shall come to the grave at a full age, As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Behold, this we have searched out; It is true. Hear it, and know for yourself."
