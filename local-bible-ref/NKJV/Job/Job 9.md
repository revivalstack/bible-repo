Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Truly I know it is so, But how can a man be righteous before God? 

<sup>3</sup> 
If one wished to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand. 

<sup>4</sup> 
God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered? 

<sup>5</sup> 
He removes the mountains, and they do not know When He overturns them in His anger; 

<sup>6</sup> 
He shakes the earth out of its place, And its pillars tremble; 

<sup>7</sup> 
He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals off the stars; 

<sup>8</sup> 
He alone spreads out the heavens, And treads on the waves of the sea; 

<sup>9</sup> 
He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south; 

<sup>10</sup> 
He does great things past finding out, Yes, wonders without number. 

<sup>11</sup> 
If He goes by me, I do not see Him; If He moves past, I do not perceive Him; 

<sup>12</sup> 
If He takes away, who can hinder Him? Who can say to Him, 'What are You doing?' 

<sup>13</sup> 
God will not withdraw His anger, The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him. 

<sup>14</sup> 
"How then can I answer Him, And choose my words to reason with Him? 

<sup>15</sup> 
For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge. 

<sup>16</sup> 
If I called and He answered me, I would not believe that He was listening to my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For He crushes me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He will not allow me to catch my breath, But fills me with bitterness. 

<sup>19</sup> 
If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong; And if of justice, who will appoint my day in court? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; Though I were blameless, it would prove me perverse. 

<sup>21</sup> 
"I am blameless, yet I do not know myself; I despise my life. 

<sup>22</sup> 
It is all one thing; Therefore I say, 'He destroys the blameless and the wicked.' 

<sup>23</sup> 
If the scourge slays suddenly, He laughs at the plight of the innocent. 

<sup>24</sup> 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, who else could it be? 

<sup>25</sup> 
"Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good. 

<sup>26</sup> 
They pass by like swift ships, Like an eagle swooping on its prey. 

<sup>27</sup> 
If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,' 

<sup>28</sup> 
I am afraid of all my sufferings; I know that You will not hold me innocent. 

<sup>29</sup> 
If I am condemned, Why then do I labor in vain? 

<sup>30</sup> 
If I wash myself with snow water, And cleanse my hands with soap, 

<sup>31</sup> 
Yet You will plunge me into the pit, And my own clothes will abhor me. 

<sup>32</sup> 
"For He is not a man, as I am, That I may answer Him, And that we should go to court together. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Nor is there any mediator between us, Who may lay his hand on us both. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Let Him take His rod away from me, And do not let dread of Him terrify me. 

<sup>35</sup> 
Then I would speak and not fear Him, But it is not so with me.
