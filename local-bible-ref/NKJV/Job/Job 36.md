Elihu also proceeded and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Bear with me a little, and I will show you That there are yet words to speak on God's behalf. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I will fetch my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For truly my words are not false; One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He does not preserve the life of the wicked, But gives justice to the oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous; But they are on the throne with kings, For He has seated them forever, And they are exalted. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And if they are bound in fetters, Held in the cords of affliction, 

<sup>9</sup> 
Then He tells them their work and their transgressions-- That they have acted defiantly. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He also opens their ear to instruction, And commands that they turn from iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> 
If they obey and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures. 

<sup>12</sup> 
But if they do not obey, They shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath; They do not cry for help when He binds them. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They die in youth, And their life ends among the perverted persons. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He delivers the poor in their affliction, And opens their ears in oppression. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress, Into a broad place where there is no restraint; And what is set on your table would be full of richness. 

<sup>17</sup> 
But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold of you. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow; For a large ransom would not help you avoid it. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Will your riches, Or all the mighty forces, Keep you from distress? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Do not desire the night, When people are cut off in their place. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Take heed, do not turn to iniquity, For you have chosen this rather than affliction. 

<sup>22</sup> 
"Behold, God is exalted by His power; Who teaches like Him? 

<sup>23</sup> 
Who has assigned Him His way, Or who has said, 'You have done wrong'? 

<sup>24</sup> 
"Remember to magnify His work, Of which men have sung. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Everyone has seen it; Man looks on it from afar. 

<sup>26</sup> 
"Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him; Nor can the number of His years be discovered. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For He draws up drops of water, Which distill as rain from the mist, 

<sup>28</sup> 
Which the clouds drop down And pour abundantly on man. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds, The thunder from His canopy? 

<sup>30</sup> 
Look, He scatters His light upon it, And covers the depths of the sea. 

<sup>31</sup> 
For by these He judges the peoples; He gives food in abundance. 

<sup>32</sup> 
He covers His hands with lightning, And commands it to strike. 

<sup>33</sup> 
His thunder declares it, The cattle also, concerning the rising storm.
