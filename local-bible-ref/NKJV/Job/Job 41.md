"Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook, Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower? 

<sup>2</sup> 
Can you put a reed through his nose, Or pierce his jaw with a hook? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Will he make many supplications to you? Will he speak softly to you? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Will he make a covenant with you? Will you take him as a servant forever? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Will you play with him as with a bird, Or will you leash him for your maidens? 

<sup>6</sup> 
Will your companions make a banquet of him? Will they apportion him among the merchants? 

<sup>7</sup> 
Can you fill his skin with harpoons, Or his head with fishing spears? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Lay your hand on him; Remember the battle-- Never do it again! 

<sup>9</sup> 
Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false; Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him? 

<sup>10</sup> 
No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up. Who then is able to stand against Me? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him? Everything under heaven is Mine. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"I will not conceal his limbs, His mighty power, or his graceful proportions. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Who can remove his outer coat? Who can approach him with a double bridle? 

<sup>14</sup> 
Who can open the doors of his face, With his terrible teeth all around? 

<sup>15</sup> 
His rows of scales are his pride, Shut up tightly as with a seal; 

<sup>16</sup> 
One is so near another That no air can come between them; 

<sup>17</sup> 
They are joined one to another, They stick together and cannot be parted. 

<sup>18</sup> 
His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Out of his mouth go burning lights; Sparks of fire shoot out. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Smoke goes out of his nostrils, As from a boiling pot and burning rushes. 

<sup>21</sup> 
His breath kindles coals, And a flame goes out of his mouth. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Strength dwells in his neck, And sorrow dances before him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The folds of his flesh are joined together; They are firm on him and cannot be moved. 

<sup>24</sup> 
His heart is as hard as stone, Even as hard as the lower millstone. 

<sup>25</sup> 
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; Because of his crashings they are beside themselves. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail; Nor does spear, dart, or javelin. 

<sup>27</sup> 
He regards iron as straw, And bronze as rotten wood. 

<sup>28</sup> 
The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones become like stubble to him. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Darts are regarded as straw; He laughs at the threat of javelins. 

<sup>30</sup> 
His undersides are like sharp potsherds; He spreads pointed marks in the mire. 

<sup>31</sup> 
He makes the deep boil like a pot; He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 

<sup>32</sup> 
He leaves a shining wake behind him; One would think the deep had white hair. 

<sup>33</sup> 
On earth there is nothing like him, Which is made without fear. 

<sup>34</sup> 
He beholds every high thing; He is king over all the children of pride."
