"But please, Job, hear my speech, And listen to all my words. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Now, I open my mouth; My tongue speaks in my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
My words come from my upright heart; My lips utter pure knowledge. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 

<sup>5</sup> 
If you can answer me, Set your words in order before me; Take your stand. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Truly I am as your spokesman before God; I also have been formed out of clay. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Surely no fear of me will terrify you, Nor will my hand be heavy on you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Surely you have spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the sound of your words, saying, 

<sup>9</sup> 
'I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Yet He finds occasions against me, He counts me as His enemy; 

<sup>11</sup> 
He puts my feet in the stocks, He watches all my paths.' 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Look, in this you are not righteous. I will answer you, For God is greater than man. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Why do you contend with Him? For He does not give an accounting of any of His words. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For God may speak in one way, or in another, Yet man does not perceive it. 

<sup>15</sup> 
In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falls upon men, While slumbering on their beds, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their instruction. 

<sup>17</sup> 
In order to turn man from his deed, And conceal pride from man, 

<sup>18</sup> 
He keeps back his soul from the Pit, And his life from perishing by the sword. 

<sup>19</sup> 
"Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, And with strong pain in many of his bones, 

<sup>20</sup> 
So that his life abhors bread, And his soul succulent food. 

<sup>21</sup> 
His flesh wastes away from sight, And his bones stick out which once were not seen. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, And his life to the executioners. 

<sup>23</sup> 
"If there is a messenger for him, A mediator, one among a thousand, To show man His uprightness, 

<sup>24</sup> 
Then He is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom'; 

<sup>25</sup> 
His flesh shall be young like a child's, He shall return to the days of his youth. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Then he looks at men and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted what was right, And it did not profit me.' 

<sup>28</sup> 
He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, And his life shall see the light. 

<sup>29</sup> 
"Behold, God works all these things, Twice, in fact, three times with a man, 

<sup>30</sup> 
To bring back his soul from the Pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of life. 

<sup>31</sup> 
"Give ear, Job, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will speak. 

<sup>32</sup> 
If you have anything to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify you. 

<sup>33</sup> 
If not, listen to me; Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
