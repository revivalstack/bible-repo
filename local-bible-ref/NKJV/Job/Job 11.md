Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be vindicated? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one rebuke you? 

<sup>4</sup> 
For you have said, 'My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in your eyes.' 

<sup>5</sup> 
But oh, that God would speak, And open His lips against you, 

<sup>6</sup> 
That He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your prudence. Know therefore that God exacts from you Less than your iniquity deserves. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Can you search out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty? 

<sup>8</sup> 
They are higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Their measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment, Then who can hinder Him? 

<sup>11</sup> 
For He knows deceitful men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it? 

<sup>12</sup> 
For an empty-headed man will be wise, When a wild donkey's colt is born a man. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"If you would prepare your heart, And stretch out your hands toward Him; 

<sup>14</sup> 
If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away, And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents; 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then surely you could lift up your face without spot; Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear; 

<sup>16</sup> 
Because you would forget your misery, And remember it as waters that have passed away, 

<sup>17</sup> 
And your life would be brighter than noonday. Though you were dark, you would be like the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> 
And you would be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety. 

<sup>19</sup> 
You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid; Yes, many would court your favor. 

<sup>20</sup> 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they shall not escape, And their hope--loss of life!"
