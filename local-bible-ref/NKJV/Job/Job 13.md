"Behold, my eye has seen all this, My ear has heard and understood it. 

<sup>2</sup> 
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 

<sup>3</sup> 
But I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But you forgers of lies, You are all worthless physicians. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Oh, that you would be silent, And it would be your wisdom! 

<sup>6</sup> 
Now hear my reasoning, And heed the pleadings of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Will you speak wickedly for God, And talk deceitfully for Him? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Will you show partiality for Him? Will you contend for God? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Will it be well when He searches you out? Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man? 

<sup>10</sup> 
He will surely rebuke you If you secretly show partiality. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Will not His excellence make you afraid, And the dread of Him fall upon you? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"Hold your peace with me, and let me speak, Then let come on me what may! 

<sup>14</sup> 
Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hands? 

<sup>15</sup> 
Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He also shall be my salvation, For a hypocrite could not come before Him. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Listen carefully to my speech, And to my declaration with your ears. 

<sup>18</sup> 
See now, I have prepared my case, I know that I shall be vindicated. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Who is he who will contend with me? If now I hold my tongue, I perish.

<sup>20</sup> 
"Only two things do not do to me, Then I will not hide myself from You: 

<sup>21</sup> 
Withdraw Your hand far from me, And let not the dread of You make me afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Then call, and I will answer; Or let me speak, then You respond to me. 

<sup>23</sup> 
How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Why do You hide Your face, And regard me as Your enemy? 

<sup>25</sup> 
Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro? And will You pursue dry stubble? 

<sup>26</sup> 
For You write bitter things against me, And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 

<sup>27</sup> 
You put my feet in the stocks, And watch closely all my paths. You set a limit for the soles of my feet. 

<sup>28</sup> 
"Man decays like a rotten thing, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.
