"But now they mock at me, men younger than I, Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me? Their vigor has perished. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They are gaunt from want and famine, Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste, 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who pluck mallow by the bushes, And broom tree roots for their food. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They were driven out from among men, They shouted at them as at a thief. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They had to live in the clefts of the valleys, In caves of the earth and the rocks. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Among the bushes they brayed, Under the nettles they nestled. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They were sons of fools, Yes, sons of vile men; They were scourged from the land. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"And now I am their taunting song; Yes, I am their byword. 

<sup>10</sup> 
They abhor me, they keep far from me; They do not hesitate to spit in my face. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me, They have cast off restraint before me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
At my right hand the rabble arises; They push away my feet, And they raise against me their ways of destruction. 

<sup>13</sup> 
They break up my path, They promote my calamity; They have no helper. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They come as broad breakers; Under the ruinous storm they roll along. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Terrors are turned upon me; They pursue my honor as the wind, And my prosperity has passed like a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"And now my soul is poured out because of my plight; The days of affliction take hold of me. 

<sup>17</sup> 
My bones are pierced in me at night, And my gnawing pains take no rest. 

<sup>18</sup> 
By great force my garment is disfigured; It binds me about as the collar of my coat. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He has cast me into the mire, And I have become like dust and ashes. 

<sup>20</sup> 
"I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You regard me. 

<sup>21</sup> 
But You have become cruel to me; With the strength of Your hand You oppose me. 

<sup>22</sup> 
You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it; You spoil my success. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For I know that You will bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living. 

<sup>24</sup> 
"Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins, If they cry out when He destroys it. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Have I not wept for him who was in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor? 

<sup>26</sup> 
But when I looked for good, evil came to me; And when I waited for light, then came darkness. 

<sup>27</sup> 
My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest; Days of affliction confront me. 

<sup>28</sup> 
I go about mourning, but not in the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help. 

<sup>29</sup> 
I am a brother of jackals, And a companion of ostriches. 

<sup>30</sup> 
My skin grows black and falls from me; My bones burn with fever. 

<sup>31</sup> 
My harp is turned to mourning, And my flute to the voice of those who weep.
