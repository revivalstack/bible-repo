Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"How long till you put an end to words? Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Why are we counted as beasts, And regarded as stupid in your sight? 

<sup>4</sup> 
You who tear yourself in anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed from its place? 

<sup>5</sup> 
"The light of the wicked indeed goes out, And the flame of his fire does not shine. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The light is dark in his tent, And his lamp beside him is put out. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The steps of his strength are shortened, And his own counsel casts him down. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walks into a snare. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The net takes him by the heel, And a snare lays hold of him. 

<sup>10</sup> 
A noose is hidden for him on the ground, And a trap for him in the road. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Terrors frighten him on every side, And drive him to his feet. 

<sup>12</sup> 
His strength is starved, And destruction is ready at his side. 

<sup>13</sup> 
It devours patches of his skin; The firstborn of death devours his limbs. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent, And they parade him before the king of terrors. 

<sup>15</sup> 
They dwell in his tent who are none of his; Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling. 

<sup>16</sup> 
His roots are dried out below, And his branch withers above. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The memory of him perishes from the earth, And he has no name among the renowned. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He is driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He has neither son nor posterity among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Those in the west are astonished at his day, As those in the east are frightened. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him who does not know God."
