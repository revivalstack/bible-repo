Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Listen carefully to my speech, And let this be your consolation. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Bear with me that I may speak, And after I have spoken, keep mocking. 

<sup>4</sup> 
"As for me, is my complaint against man? And if it were, why should I not be impatient? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Look at me and be astonished; Put your hand over your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Even when I remember I am terrified, And trembling takes hold of my flesh. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Why do the wicked live and become old, Yes, become mighty in power? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Their descendants are established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Their bull breeds without failure; Their cow calves without miscarriage. 

<sup>11</sup> 
They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance. 

<sup>12</sup> 
They sing to the tambourine and harp, And rejoice to the sound of the flute. 

<sup>13</sup> 
They spend their days in wealth, And in a moment go down to the grave. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Yet they say to God, 'Depart from us, For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?' 

<sup>16</sup> 
Indeed their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? How often does their destruction come upon them, The sorrows God distributes in His anger? 

<sup>18</sup> 
They are like straw before the wind, And like chaff that a storm carries away. 

<sup>19</sup> 
They say, 'God lays up one's iniquity for his children'; Let Him recompense him, that he may know it. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Let his eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For what does he care about his household after him, When the number of his months is cut in half? 

<sup>22</sup> 
"Can anyone teach God knowledge, Since He judges those on high? 

<sup>23</sup> 
One dies in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and secure; 

<sup>24</sup> 
His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moist. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, Never having eaten with pleasure. 

<sup>26</sup> 
They lie down alike in the dust, And worms cover them. 

<sup>27</sup> 
"Look, I know your thoughts, And the schemes with which you would wrong me. 

<sup>28</sup> 
For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent, The dwelling place of the wicked?' 

<sup>29</sup> 
Have you not asked those who travel the road? And do you not know their signs? 

<sup>30</sup> 
For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom; They shall be brought out on the day of wrath. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Who condemns his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done? 

<sup>32</sup> 
Yet he shall be brought to the grave, And a vigil kept over the tomb. 

<sup>33</sup> 
The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; Everyone shall follow him, As countless have gone before him. 

<sup>34</sup> 
How then can you comfort me with empty words, Since falsehood remains in your answers?"
