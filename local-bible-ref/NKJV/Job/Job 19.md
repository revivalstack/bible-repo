Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"How long will you torment my soul, And break me in pieces with words? 

<sup>3</sup> 
These ten times you have reproached me; You are not ashamed that you have wronged me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And if indeed I have erred, My error remains with me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
If indeed you exalt yourselves against me, And plead my disgrace against me, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Know then that God has wronged me, And has surrounded me with His net. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard. If I cry aloud, there is no justice. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass; And He has set darkness in my paths. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He has stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He breaks me down on every side, And I am gone; My hope He has uprooted like a tree. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He has also kindled His wrath against me, And He counts me as one of His enemies. 

<sup>12</sup> 
His troops come together And build up their road against me; They encamp all around my tent. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"He has removed my brothers far from me, And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me. 

<sup>14</sup> 
My relatives have failed, And my close friends have forgotten me. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants, Count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I call my servant, but he gives no answer; I beg him with my mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> 
My breath is offensive to my wife, And I am repulsive to the children of my own body. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Even young children despise me; I arise, and they speak against me. 

<sup>19</sup> 
All my close friends abhor me, And those whom I love have turned against me. 

<sup>20</sup> 
My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

<sup>21</sup> 
"Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends, For the hand of God has struck me! 

<sup>22</sup> 
Why do you persecute me as God does, And are not satisfied with my flesh? 

<sup>23</sup> 
"Oh, that my words were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book! 

<sup>24</sup> 
That they were engraved on a rock With an iron pen and lead, forever! 

<sup>25</sup> 
For I know that my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth; 

<sup>26</sup> 
And after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 

<sup>27</sup> 
Whom I shall see for myself, And my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me! 

<sup>28</sup> 
If you should say, 'How shall we persecute him?'-- Since the root of the matter is found in me, 

<sup>29</sup> 
Be afraid of the sword for yourselves; For wrath brings the punishment of the sword, That you may know there is a judgment."
