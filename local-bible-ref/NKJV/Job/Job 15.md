Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or by speeches with which he can do no good? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Yes, you cast off fear, And restrain prayer before God. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, And you choose the tongue of the crafty. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; Yes, your own lips testify against you. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Are you the first man who was born? Or were you made before the hills? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? 

<sup>9</sup> 
What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not in us? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, Much older than your father. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Are the consolations of God too small for you, And the word spoken gently with you? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Why does your heart carry you away, And what do your eyes wink at, 

<sup>13</sup> 
That you turn your spirit against God, And let such words go out of your mouth? 

<sup>14</sup> 
"What is man, that he could be pure? And he who is born of a woman, that he could be righteous? 

<sup>15</sup> 
If God puts no trust in His saints, And the heavens are not pure in His sight, 

<sup>16</sup> 
How much less man, who is abominable and filthy, Who drinks iniquity like water! 

<sup>17</sup> 
"I will tell you, hear me; What I have seen I will declare, 

<sup>18</sup> 
What wise men have told, Not hiding anything received from their fathers, 

<sup>19</sup> 
To whom alone the land was given, And no alien passed among them: 

<sup>20</sup> 
The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Dreadful sounds are in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him. 

<sup>22</sup> 
He does not believe that he will return from darkness, For a sword is waiting for him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He wanders about for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Trouble and anguish make him afraid; They overpower him, like a king ready for battle. 

<sup>25</sup> 
For he stretches out his hand against God, And acts defiantly against the Almighty, 

<sup>26</sup> 
Running stubbornly against Him With his strong, embossed shield. 

<sup>27</sup> 
"Though he has covered his face with his fatness, And made his waist heavy with fat, 

<sup>28</sup> 
He dwells in desolate cities, In houses which no one inhabits, Which are destined to become ruins. 

<sup>29</sup> 
He will not be rich, Nor will his wealth continue, Nor will his possessions overspread the earth. 

<sup>30</sup> 
He will not depart from darkness; The flame will dry out his branches, And by the breath of His mouth he will go away. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Let him not trust in futile things, deceiving himself, For futility will be his reward. 

<sup>32</sup> 
It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green. 

<sup>33</sup> 
He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine, And cast off his blossom like an olive tree. 

<sup>34</sup> 
For the company of hypocrites will be barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery. 

<sup>35</sup> 
They conceive trouble and bring forth futility; Their womb prepares deceit."
