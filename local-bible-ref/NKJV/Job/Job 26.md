But Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"How have you helped him who is without power? How have you saved the arm that has no strength? 

<sup>3</sup> 
How have you counseled one who has no wisdom? And how have you declared sound advice to many? 

<sup>4</sup> 
To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit came from you? 

<sup>5</sup> 
"The dead tremble, Those under the waters and those inhabiting them. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Sheol is naked before Him, And Destruction has no covering. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth on nothing. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He binds up the water in His thick clouds, Yet the clouds are not broken under it. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He covers the face of His throne, And spreads His cloud over it. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters, At the boundary of light and darkness. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The pillars of heaven tremble, And are astonished at His rebuke. 

<sup>12</sup> 
He stirs up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He breaks up the storm. 

<sup>13</sup> 
By His Spirit He adorned the heavens; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways, And how small a whisper we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand?"
