"Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young? Or can you mark when the deer gives birth? 

<sup>2</sup> 
Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bear young? 

<sup>3</sup> 
They bow down, They bring forth their young, They deliver their offspring. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Their young ones are healthy, They grow strong with grain; They depart and do not return to them. 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bonds of the onager, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the barren land his dwelling? 

<sup>7</sup> 
He scorns the tumult of the city; He does not heed the shouts of the driver. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searches after every green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"Will the wild ox be willing to serve you? Will he bed by your manger? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes? Or will he plow the valleys behind you? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Will you trust him to bring home your grain, And gather it to your threshing floor? 

<sup>13</sup> 
"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork's? 

<sup>14</sup> 
For she leaves her eggs on the ground, And warms them in the dust; 

<sup>15</sup> 
She forgets that a foot may crush them, Or that a wild beast may break them. 

<sup>16</sup> 
She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers; Her labor is in vain, without concern, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Because God deprived her of wisdom, And did not endow her with understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> 
When she lifts herself on high, She scorns the horse and its rider. 

<sup>19</sup> 
"Have you given the horse strength? Have you clothed his neck with thunder? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Can you frighten him like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; He gallops into the clash of arms. 

<sup>22</sup> 
He mocks at fear, and is not frightened; Nor does he turn back from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The quiver rattles against him, The glittering spear and javelin. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He devours the distance with fierceness and rage; Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet has sounded. 

<sup>25</sup> 
At the blast of the trumpet he says, 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, The thunder of captains and shouting. 

<sup>26</sup> 
"Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, And spread its wings toward the south? 

<sup>27</sup> 
Does the eagle mount up at your command, And make its nest on high? 

<sup>28</sup> 
On the rock it dwells and resides, On the crag of the rock and the stronghold. 

<sup>29</sup> 
From there it spies out the prey; Its eyes observe from afar. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Its young ones suck up blood; And where the slain are, there it is."
