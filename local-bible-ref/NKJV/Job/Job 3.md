After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And Job spoke, and said: 

<sup>3</sup> 
"May the day perish on which I was born, And the night in which it was said, 'A male child is conceived.' 

<sup>4</sup> 
May that day be darkness; May God above not seek it, Nor the light shine upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> 
May darkness and the shadow of death claim it; May a cloud settle on it; May the blackness of the day terrify it. 

<sup>6</sup> 
As for that night, may darkness seize it; May it not rejoice among the days of the year, May it not come into the number of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Oh, may that night be barren! May no joyful shout come into it! 

<sup>8</sup> 
May those curse it who curse the day, Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan. 

<sup>9</sup> 
May the stars of its morning be dark; May it look for light, but have none, And not see the dawning of the day; 

<sup>10</sup> 
Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb, Nor hide sorrow from my eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> 
"Why did I not die at birth? Why did I not perish when I came from the womb? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse? 

<sup>13</sup> 
For now I would have lain still and been quiet, I would have been asleep; Then I would have been at rest 

<sup>14</sup> 
With kings and counselors of the earth, Who built ruins for themselves, 

<sup>15</sup> 
Or with princes who had gold, Who filled their houses with silver; 

<sup>16</sup> 
Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, Like infants who never saw light? 

<sup>17</sup> 
There the wicked cease from troubling, And there the weary are at rest. 

<sup>18</sup> 
There the prisoners rest together; They do not hear the voice of the oppressor. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The small and great are there, And the servant is free from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> 
"Why is light given to him who is in misery, And life to the bitter of soul, 

<sup>21</sup> 
Who long for death, but it does not come, And search for it more than hidden treasures; 

<sup>22</sup> 
Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad when they can find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> 
Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And whom God has hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> 
For my sighing comes before I eat, And my groanings pour out like water. 

<sup>25</sup> 
For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me, And what I dreaded has happened to me. 

<sup>26</sup> 
I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, for trouble comes."
