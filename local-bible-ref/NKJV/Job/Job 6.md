Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Oh, that my grief were fully weighed, And my calamity laid with it on the scales! 

<sup>3</sup> 
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea-- Therefore my words have been rash. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; My spirit drinks in their poison; The terrors of God are arrayed against me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass, Or does the ox low over its fodder? 

<sup>6</sup> 
Can flavorless food be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

<sup>7</sup> 
My soul refuses to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Oh, that I might have my request, That God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

<sup>9</sup> 
That it would please God to crush me, That He would loose His hand and cut me off! 

<sup>10</sup> 
Then I would still have comfort; Though in anguish I would exult, He will not spare; For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 

<sup>11</sup> 
"What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze? 

<sup>13</sup> 
Is my help not within me? And is success driven from me? 

<sup>14</sup> 
"To him who is afflicted, kindness should be shown by his friend, Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook, Like the streams of the brooks that pass away, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Which are dark because of the ice, And into which the snow vanishes. 

<sup>17</sup> 
When it is warm, they cease to flow; When it is hot, they vanish from their place. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The paths of their way turn aside, They go nowhere and perish. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The caravans of Tema look, The travelers of Sheba hope for them. 

<sup>20</sup> 
They are disappointed because they were confident; They come there and are confused. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For now you are nothing, You see terror and are afraid. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Did I ever say, 'Bring something to me'? Or, 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth'? 

<sup>23</sup> 
Or, 'Deliver me from the enemy's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of oppressors'? 

<sup>24</sup> 
"Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; Cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

<sup>25</sup> 
How forceful are right words! But what does your arguing prove? 

<sup>26</sup> 
Do you intend to rebuke my words, And the speeches of a desperate one, which are as wind? 

<sup>27</sup> 
Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, And you undermine your friend. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; For I would never lie to your face. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Yield now, let there be no injustice! Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands! 

<sup>30</sup> 
Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?
