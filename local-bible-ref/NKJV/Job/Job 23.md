Then Job answered and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Even today my complaint is bitter; My hand is listless because of my groaning. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat! 

<sup>4</sup> 
I would present my case before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I would know the words which He would answer me, And understand what He would say to me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Would He contend with me in His great power? No! But He would take note of me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
There the upright could reason with Him, And I would be delivered forever from my Judge. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Look, I go forward, but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him; 

<sup>9</sup> 
When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold Him; When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth More than my necessary food. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"But He is unique, and who can make Him change? And whatever His soul desires, that He does. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such things are with Him. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Therefore I am terrified at His presence; When I consider this, I am afraid of Him. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For God made my heart weak, And the Almighty terrifies me; 

<sup>17</sup> 
Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness, And He did not hide deep darkness from my face.
