Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him? He who rebukes God, let him answer it." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then Job answered the Lord and said: 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Behold, I am vile; What shall I answer You? I lay my hand over my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said: 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Now prepare yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer Me: 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Would you indeed annul My judgment? Would you condemn Me that you may be justified? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor, And array yourself with glory and beauty. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Disperse the rage of your wrath; Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low; Tread down the wicked in their place. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Hide them in the dust together, Bind their faces in hidden darkness. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Then I will also confess to you That your own right hand can save you. 

<sup>15</sup> 
"Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you; He eats grass like an ox. 

<sup>16</sup> 
See now, his strength is in his hips, And his power is in his stomach muscles. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He moves his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit. 

<sup>18</sup> 
His bones are like beams of bronze, His ribs like bars of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He is the first of the ways of God; Only He who made him can bring near His sword. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Surely the mountains yield food for him, And all the beasts of the field play there. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He lies under the lotus trees, In a covert of reeds and marsh. 

<sup>22</sup> 
The lotus trees cover him with their shade; The willows by the brook surround him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Indeed the river may rage, Yet he is not disturbed; He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth, 

<sup>24</sup> 
Though he takes it in his eyes, Or one pierces his nose with a snare.
