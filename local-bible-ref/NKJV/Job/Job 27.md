Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"As God lives, who has taken away my justice, And the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter, 

<sup>3</sup> 
As long as my breath is in me, And the breath of God in my nostrils, 

<sup>4</sup> 
My lips will not speak wickedness, Nor my tongue utter deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Far be it from me That I should say you are right; Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; My heart shall not reproach me as long as I live. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"May my enemy be like the wicked, And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, Though he may gain much, If God takes away his life? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Will God hear his cry When trouble comes upon him? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call on God? 

<sup>11</sup> 
"I will teach you about the hand of God; What is with the Almighty I will not conceal. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Surely all of you have seen it; Why then do you behave with complete nonsense? 

<sup>13</sup> 
"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty: 

<sup>14</sup> 
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Those who survive him shall be buried in death, And their widows shall not weep, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Though he heaps up silver like dust, And piles up clothing like clay-- 

<sup>17</sup> 
He may pile it up, but the just will wear it, And the innocent will divide the silver. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He builds his house like a moth, Like a booth which a watchman makes. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The rich man will lie down, But not be gathered up; He opens his eyes, And he is no more. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Terrors overtake him like a flood; A tempest steals him away in the night. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; It sweeps him out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> 
It hurls against him and does not spare; He flees desperately from its power. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.
