"My spirit is broken, My days are extinguished, The grave is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their provocation? 

<sup>3</sup> 
"Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself. Who is he who will shake hands with me? 

<sup>4</sup> 
For You have hidden their heart from understanding; Therefore You will not exalt them. 

<sup>5</sup> 
He who speaks flattery to his friends, Even the eyes of his children will fail. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"But He has made me a byword of the people, And I have become one in whose face men spit. 

<sup>7</sup> 
My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow, And all my members are like shadows. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Yet the righteous will hold to his way, And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"But please, come back again, all of you, For I shall not find one wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My days are past, My purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart. 

<sup>12</sup> 
They change the night into day; 'The light is near,' they say, in the face of darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> 
If I wait for the grave as my house, If I make my bed in the darkness, 

<sup>14</sup> 
If I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' And to the worm, 'You are my mother and my sister,' 

<sup>15</sup> 
Where then is my hope? As for my hope, who can see it? 

<sup>16</sup> 
Will they go down to the gates of Sheol? Shall we have rest together in the dust?"
