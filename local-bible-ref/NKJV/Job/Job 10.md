"My soul loathes my life; I will give free course to my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me; Show me why You contend with me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Does it seem good to You that You should oppress, That You should despise the work of Your hands, And smile on the counsel of the wicked? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Do You have eyes of flesh? Or do You see as man sees? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Are Your days like the days of a mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man, 

<sup>6</sup> 
That You should seek for my iniquity And search out my sin, 

<sup>7</sup> 
Although You know that I am not wicked, And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> 
'Your hands have made me and fashioned me, An intricate unity; Yet You would destroy me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Did You not pour me out like milk, And curdle me like cheese, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Clothe me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews? 

<sup>12</sup> 
You have granted me life and favor, And Your care has preserved my spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> 
'And these things You have hidden in Your heart; I know that this was with You: 

<sup>14</sup> 
If I sin, then You mark me, And will not acquit me of my iniquity. 

<sup>15</sup> 
If I am wicked, woe to me; Even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head. I am full of disgrace; See my misery! 

<sup>16</sup> 
If my head is exalted, You hunt me like a fierce lion, And again You show Yourself awesome against me. 

<sup>17</sup> 
You renew Your witnesses against me, And increase Your indignation toward me; Changes and war are ever with me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
'Why then have You brought me out of the womb? Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me! 

<sup>19</sup> 
I would have been as though I had not been. I would have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Are not my days few? Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort, 

<sup>21</sup> 
Before I go to the place from which I shall not return, To the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 

<sup>22</sup> 
A land as dark as darkness itself, As the shadow of death, without any order, Where even the light is like darkness.' "
