"Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place where gold is refined. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Iron is taken from the earth, And copper is smelted from ore. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Man puts an end to darkness, And searches every recess For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He breaks open a shaft away from people; In places forgotten by feet They hang far away from men; They swing to and fro. 

<sup>5</sup> 
As for the earth, from it comes bread, But underneath it is turned up as by fire; 

<sup>6</sup> 
Its stones are the source of sapphires, And it contains gold dust. 

<sup>7</sup> 
That path no bird knows, Nor has the falcon's eye seen it. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The proud lions have not trodden it, Nor has the fierce lion passed over it. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He puts his hand on the flint; He overturns the mountains at the roots. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He cuts out channels in the rocks, And his eye sees every precious thing. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He dams up the streams from trickling; What is hidden he brings forth to light. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 

<sup>13</sup> 
Man does not know its value, Nor is it found in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The deep says, 'It is not in me'; And the sea says, 'It is not with me.' 

<sup>15</sup> 
It cannot be purchased for gold, Nor can silver be weighed for its price. 

<sup>16</sup> 
It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, In precious onyx or sapphire. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Neither gold nor crystal can equal it, Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold. 

<sup>18</sup> 
No mention shall be made of coral or quartz, For the price of wisdom is above rubies. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, Nor can it be valued in pure gold. 

<sup>20</sup> 
"From where then does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? 

<sup>21</sup> 
It is hidden from the eyes of all living, And concealed from the birds of the air. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Destruction and Death say, 'We have heard a report about it with our ears.' 

<sup>23</sup> 
God understands its way, And He knows its place. 

<sup>24</sup> 
For He looks to the ends of the earth, And sees under the whole heavens, 

<sup>25</sup> 
To establish a weight for the wind, And apportion the waters by measure. 

<sup>26</sup> 
When He made a law for the rain, And a path for the thunderbolt, 

<sup>27</sup> 
Then He saw wisdom and declared it; He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out. 

<sup>28</sup> 
And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to depart from evil is understanding.' "
