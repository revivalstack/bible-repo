<sup>3</sup> 
"An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the assembly of the Lord; even to the tenth generation none of his descendants shall enter the assembly of the Lord forever, 

<sup>4</sup> 
because they did not meet you with bread and water on the road when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Nevertheless the Lord your God would not listen to Balaam, but the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the Lord your God loves you. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever. 

<sup>7</sup>

But it shall be, when evening comes, that he shall wash with water; and when the sun sets, he may come into the camp. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Also you shall have a place outside the camp, where you may go out; 

<sup>13</sup> 
and you shall have an implement among your equipment, and when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and turn and cover your refuse. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For the Lord your God walks in the midst of your camp, to deliver you and give your enemies over to you; therefore your camp shall be holy, that He may see no unclean thing among you, and turn away from you.

<sup>15</sup> 
"You shall not give back to his master the slave who has escaped from his master to you.

"You shall not charge interest to your brother--interest on money or food or anything that is lent out at interest. 

<sup>20</sup> 
To a foreigner you may charge interest, but to your brother you shall not charge interest, that the Lord your God may bless you in all to which you set your hand in the land which you are entering to possess. 

<sup>21</sup> 
"When you make a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for the Lord your God will surely require it of you, and it would be sin to you. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But if you abstain from vowing, it shall not be sin to you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
That which has gone from your lips you shall keep and perform, for you voluntarily vowed to the Lord your God what you have promised with your mouth. 

<sup>24</sup>

<sup>25</sup>
