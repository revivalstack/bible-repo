<sup>1</sup> 
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; Defend me from those who rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And save me from bloodthirsty men. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For look, they lie in wait for my life; The mighty gather against me, Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They run and prepare themselves through no fault of mine. Awake to help me, and behold! 

<sup>5</sup> 
You therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> 
At evening they return, They growl like a dog, And go all around the city. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Indeed, they belch with their mouth; Swords are in their lips; For they say, "Who hears?" 

<sup>8</sup> 
But You, O Lord, shall laugh at them; You shall have all the nations in derision. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will wait for You, O You his Strength; For God is my defense. 

<sup>10</sup> 
My God of mercy shall come to meet me; God shall let me see my desire on my enemies. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Do not slay them, lest my people forget; Scatter them by Your power, And bring them down, O Lord our shield. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for the cursing and lying which they speak. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Consume them in wrath, consume them, That they may not be; And let them know that God rules in Jacob To the ends of the earth. Selah 

<sup>14</sup> 
And at evening they return, They growl like a dog, And go all around the city. 

<sup>15</sup> 
They wander up and down for food, And howl if they are not satisfied. 

<sup>16</sup> 
But I will sing of Your power; Yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning; For You have been my defense And refuge in the day of my trouble. 

<sup>17</sup> 
To You, O my Strength, I will sing praises; For God is my defense, My God of mercy.
