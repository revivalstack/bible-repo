<sup>1</sup> 
Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Sing out the honor of His name; Make His praise glorious. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Say to God, "How awesome are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies shall submit themselves to You. 

<sup>4</sup> 
All the earth shall worship You And sing praises to You; They shall sing praises to Your name." Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
Come and see the works of God; He is awesome in His doing toward the sons of men. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot. There we will rejoice in Him. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He rules by His power forever; His eyes observe the nations; Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> 
Oh, bless our God, you peoples! And make the voice of His praise to be heard, 

<sup>9</sup> 
Who keeps our soul among the living, And does not allow our feet to be moved. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined. 

<sup>11</sup> 
You brought us into the net; You laid affliction on our backs. 

<sup>12</sup> 
You have caused men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But You brought us out to rich fulfillment. 

<sup>13</sup> 
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings; I will pay You my vows, 

<sup>14</sup> 
Which my lips have uttered And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals, With the sweet aroma of rams; I will offer bulls with goats. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> 
Come and hear, all you who fear God, And I will declare what He has done for my soul. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I cried to Him with my mouth, And He was extolled with my tongue. 

<sup>18</sup> 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear. 

<sup>19</sup> 
But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Blessed be God, Who has not turned away my prayer, Nor His mercy from me!
