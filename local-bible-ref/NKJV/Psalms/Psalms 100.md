<sup>1</sup> 
Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Serve the Lord with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, And His truth endures to all generations.
