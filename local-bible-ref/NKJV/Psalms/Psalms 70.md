<sup>1</sup> 
Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Make haste to help me, O Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let them be ashamed and confounded Who seek my life; Let them be turned back and confused Who desire my hurt. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let them be turned back because of their shame, Who say, "Aha, aha!" 

<sup>4</sup> 
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified!" 

<sup>5</sup> 
But I am poor and needy; Make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O Lord, do not delay.
