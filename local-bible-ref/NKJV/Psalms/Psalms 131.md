Lord, my heart is not haughty, Nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I concern myself with great matters, Nor with things too profound for me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul, Like a weaned child with his mother; Like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
O Israel, hope in the Lord From this time forth and forever.
