<sup>1</sup> 
Give the king Your judgments, O God, And Your righteousness to the king's Son. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He will judge Your people with righteousness, And Your poor with justice. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The mountains will bring peace to the people, And the little hills, by righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He will bring justice to the poor of the people; He will save the children of the needy, And will break in pieces the oppressor. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They shall fear You As long as the sun and moon endure, Throughout all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He shall come down like rain upon the grass before mowing, Like showers that water the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> 
In His days the righteous shall flourish, And abundance of peace, Until the moon is no more. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before Him, And His enemies will lick the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles Will bring presents; The kings of Sheba and Seba Will offer gifts. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him; All nations shall serve Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For He will deliver the needy when he cries, The poor also, and him who has no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He will spare the poor and needy, And will save the souls of the needy. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He will redeem their life from oppression and violence; And precious shall be their blood in His sight. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And He shall live; And the gold of Sheba will be given to Him; Prayer also will be made for Him continually, And daily He shall be praised. 

<sup>16</sup> 
There will be an abundance of grain in the earth, On the top of the mountains; Its fruit shall wave like Lebanon; And those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> 
His name shall endure forever; His name shall continue as long as the sun. And men shall be blessed in Him; All nations shall call Him blessed. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, Who only does wondrous things! 

<sup>19</sup> 
And blessed be His glorious name forever! And let the whole earth be filled with His glory. Amen and Amen. 

<sup>20</sup> 
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
