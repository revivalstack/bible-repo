<sup>1</sup> 
Bless the Lord, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless His holy name! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Bless the Lord, O my soul, And forget not all His benefits: 

<sup>3</sup> 
Who forgives all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who redeems your life from destruction, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Who satisfies your mouth with good things, So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The Lord executes righteousness And justice for all who are oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abounding in mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He will not always strive with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor punished us according to our iniquities. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him; 

<sup>12</sup> 
As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us. 

<sup>13</sup> 
As a father pities his children, So the Lord pities those who fear Him. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust. 

<sup>15</sup> 
As for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, And its place remembers it no more. 

<sup>17</sup> 
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting On those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children, 

<sup>18</sup> 
To such as keep His covenant, And to those who remember His commandments to do them. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The Lord has established His throne in heaven, And His kingdom rules over all. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Bless the Lord, you His angels, Who excel in strength, who do His word, Heeding the voice of His word. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Bless the Lord, all you His hosts, You ministers of His, who do His pleasure. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Bless the Lord, all His works, In all places of His dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul!
