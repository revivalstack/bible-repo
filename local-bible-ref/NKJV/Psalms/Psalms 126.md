<sup>1</sup> 
When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." 

<sup>3</sup> 
The Lord has done great things for us, And we are glad. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Bring back our captivity, O Lord, As the streams in the South. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.
