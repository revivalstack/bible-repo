<sup>1</sup> 
Have mercy upon me, O God, According to Your lovingkindness; According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, Blot out my transgressions. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For I acknowledge my transgressions, And my sin is always before me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Against You, You only, have I sinned, And done this evil in Your sight-- That You may be found just when You speak, And blameless when You judge. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother conceived me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Make me hear joy and gladness, That the bones You have broken may rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Hide Your face from my sins, And blot out all my iniquities. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And uphold me by Your generous Spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners shall be converted to You. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, The God of my salvation, And my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness. 

<sup>15</sup> 
O Lord, open my lips, And my mouth shall show forth Your praise. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart-- These, O God, You will not despise. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, With burnt offering and whole burnt offering; Then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.
