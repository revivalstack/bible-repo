<sup>1</sup> 
To You I will cry, O Lord my Rock: Do not be silent to me, Lest, if You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Hear the voice of my supplications When I cry to You, When I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Do not take me away with the wicked And with the workers of iniquity, Who speak peace to their neighbors, But evil is in their hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Give them according to their deeds, And according to the wickedness of their endeavors; Give them according to the work of their hands; Render to them what they deserve. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Because they do not regard the works of the Lord, Nor the operation of His hands, He shall destroy them And not build them up. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord, Because He has heard the voice of my supplications! 

<sup>7</sup> 
The Lord is my strength and my shield; My heart trusted in Him, and I am helped; Therefore my heart greatly rejoices, And with my song I will praise Him. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord is their strength, And He is the saving refuge of His anointed. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Save Your people, And bless Your inheritance; Shepherd them also, And bear them up forever.
