Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, But to Your name give glory, Because of Your mercy, Because of Your truth. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Why should the Gentiles say, "So where is their God?" 

<sup>3</sup> 
But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Their idols are silver and gold, The work of men's hands. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They have mouths, but they do not speak; Eyes they have, but they do not see; 

<sup>6</sup> 
They have ears, but they do not hear; Noses they have, but they do not smell; 

<sup>7</sup> 
They have hands, but they do not handle; Feet they have, but they do not walk; Nor do they mutter through their throat. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Those who make them are like them; So is everyone who trusts in them. 

<sup>9</sup> 
O Israel, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>10</sup> 
O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>11</sup> 
You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The Lord has been mindful of us; He will bless us; He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He will bless those who fear the Lord, Both small and great. 

<sup>14</sup> 
May the Lord give you increase more and more, You and your children. 

<sup>15</sup> 
May you be blessed by the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's; But the earth He has given to the children of men. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The dead do not praise the Lord, Nor any who go down into silence. 

<sup>18</sup> 
But we will bless the Lord From this time forth and forevermore. Praise the Lord!
