<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, Who delights greatly in His commandments. 

<sup>2</sup> 
His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Wealth and riches will be in his house, And his righteousness endures forever. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 

<sup>5</sup> 
A good man deals graciously and lends; He will guide his affairs with discretion. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Surely he will never be shaken; The righteous will be in everlasting remembrance. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He will not be afraid of evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 
His heart is established; He will not be afraid, Until he sees his desire upon his enemies. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted with honor. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The wicked will see it and be grieved; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.
