O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth, Who have set Your glory above the heavens! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, Because of Your enemies, That You may silence the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>3</sup> 
When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, 

<sup>4</sup> 
What is man that You are mindful of him, And the son of man that You visit him? 

<sup>5</sup> 
For You have made him a little lower than the angels, And You have crowned him with glory and honor. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, 

<sup>7</sup> 
All sheep and oxen-- Even the beasts of the field, 

<sup>8</sup> 
The birds of the air, And the fish of the sea That pass through the paths of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> 
O Lord, our Lord, How excellent is Your name in all the earth!
