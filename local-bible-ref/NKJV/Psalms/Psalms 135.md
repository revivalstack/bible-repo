<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Praise the name of the Lord; Praise Him, O you servants of the Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 
You who stand in the house of the Lord, In the courts of the house of our God, 

<sup>3</sup> 
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; Sing praises to His name, for it is pleasant. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel for His special treasure. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For I know that the Lord is great, And our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Whatever the Lord pleases He does, In heaven and in earth, In the seas and in all deep places. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain; He brings the wind out of His treasuries. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, Both of man and beast. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh and all his servants. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He defeated many nations And slew mighty kings-- 

<sup>11</sup> 
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan-- 

<sup>12</sup> 
And gave their land as a heritage, A heritage to Israel His people. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Your name, O Lord, endures forever, Your fame, O Lord, throughout all generations. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For the Lord will judge His people, And He will have compassion on His servants. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands. 

<sup>16</sup> 
They have mouths, but they do not speak; Eyes they have, but they do not see; 

<sup>17</sup> 
They have ears, but they do not hear; Nor is there any breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Those who make them are like them; So is everyone who trusts in them. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Bless the Lord, O house of Israel! Bless the Lord, O house of Aaron! 

<sup>20</sup> 
Bless the Lord, O house of Levi! You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord! 

<sup>21</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, Who dwells in Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!
