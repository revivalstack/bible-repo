<sup>1</sup> 
Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; 

<sup>2</sup> 
But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The ungodly are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind drives away. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, But the way of the ungodly shall perish.
