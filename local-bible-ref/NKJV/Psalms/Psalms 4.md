Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved me in my distress; Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> 
How long, O you sons of men, Will you turn my glory to shame? How long will you love worthlessness And seek falsehood? Selah 

<sup>3</sup> 
But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself him who is godly; The Lord will hear when I call to Him. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Be angry, and do not sin. Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 
There are many who say, "Who will show us any good?" Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You have put gladness in my heart, More than in the season that their grain and wine increased. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I will both lie down in peace, and sleep; For You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.
