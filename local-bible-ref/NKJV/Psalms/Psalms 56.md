<sup>1</sup> 
Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; Fighting all day he oppresses me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
My enemies would hound me all day, For there are many who fight against me, O Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You. 

<sup>4</sup> 
In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me? 

<sup>5</sup> 
All day they twist my words; All their thoughts are against me for evil. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They gather together, They hide, they mark my steps, When they lie in wait for my life. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God! 

<sup>8</sup> 
You number my wanderings; Put my tears into Your bottle; Are they not in Your book? 

<sup>9</sup> 
When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back; This I know, because God is for me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
In God (I will praise His word), In the Lord (I will praise His word), 

<sup>11</sup> 
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Vows made to You are binding upon me, O God; I will render praises to You, 

<sup>13</sup> 
For You have delivered my soul from death. Have You not kept my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?
