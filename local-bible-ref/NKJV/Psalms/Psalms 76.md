There He broke the arrows of the bow, The shield and sword of battle. Selah

You are more glorious and excellent Than the mountains of prey. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The stouthearted were plundered; They have sunk into their sleep; And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands. 

<sup>6</sup> 
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep.

You, Yourself, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence When once You are angry?

You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still, 

<sup>9</sup> 
When God arose to judgment, To deliver all the oppressed of the earth. Selah 

<sup>10</sup> 
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Make vows to the Lord your God, and pay them; Let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who ought to be feared. 

<sup>12</sup> 
He shall cut off the spirit of princes; He is awesome to the kings of the earth.
