<sup>1</sup> 
When Israel went out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 

<sup>2</sup> 
Judah became His sanctuary, And Israel His dominion. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The sea saw it and fled; Jordan turned back. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs. 

<sup>5</sup> 
What ails you, O sea, that you fled? O Jordan, that you turned back? 

<sup>6</sup> 
O mountains, that you skipped like rams? O little hills, like lambs? 

<sup>7</sup> 
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
