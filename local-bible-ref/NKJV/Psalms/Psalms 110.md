The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool." 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power; In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord has sworn And will not relent, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 

<sup>5</sup> 
The Lord is at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill the places with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.
