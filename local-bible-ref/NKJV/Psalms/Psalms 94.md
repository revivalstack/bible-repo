O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs-- O God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Rise up, O Judge of the earth; Render punishment to the proud. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Lord, how long will the wicked, How long will the wicked triumph? 

<sup>4</sup> 
They utter speech, and speak insolent things; All the workers of iniquity boast in themselves. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They break in pieces Your people, O Lord, And afflict Your heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They slay the widow and the stranger, And murder the fatherless. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Yet they say, "The Lord does not see, Nor does the God of Jacob understand." 

<sup>8</sup> 
Understand, you senseless among the people; And you fools, when will you be wise? 

<sup>9</sup> 
He who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He who formed the eye, shall He not see? 

<sup>10</sup> 
He who instructs the nations, shall He not correct, He who teaches man knowledge? 

<sup>11</sup> 
The Lord knows the thoughts of man, That they are futile. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Blessed is the man whom You instruct, O Lord, And teach out of Your law, 

<sup>13</sup> 
That You may give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit is dug for the wicked. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For the Lord will not cast off His people, Nor will He forsake His inheritance. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But judgment will return to righteousness, And all the upright in heart will follow it. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Unless the Lord had been my help, My soul would soon have settled in silence. 

<sup>18</sup> 
If I say, "My foot slips," Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up. 

<sup>19</sup> 
In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Shall the throne of iniquity, which devises evil by law, Have fellowship with You? 

<sup>21</sup> 
They gather together against the life of the righteous, And condemn innocent blood. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But the Lord has been my defense, And my God the rock of my refuge. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He has brought on them their own iniquity, And shall cut them off in their own wickedness; The Lord our God shall cut them off.
