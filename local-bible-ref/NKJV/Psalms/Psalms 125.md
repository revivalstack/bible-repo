<sup>1</sup> 
Those who trust in the Lord Are like Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 

<sup>2</sup> 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts. 

<sup>5</sup> 
As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord shall lead them away With the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!
