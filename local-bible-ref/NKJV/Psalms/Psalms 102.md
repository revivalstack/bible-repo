<sup>1</sup> 
Hear my prayer, O Lord, And let my cry come to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my trouble; Incline Your ear to me; In the day that I call, answer me speedily. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For my days are consumed like smoke, And my bones are burned like a hearth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
My heart is stricken and withered like grass, So that I forget to eat my bread. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Because of the sound of my groaning My bones cling to my skin. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I lie awake, And am like a sparrow alone on the housetop. 

<sup>8</sup> 
My enemies reproach me all day long; Those who deride me swear an oath against me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For I have eaten ashes like bread, And mingled my drink with weeping, 

<sup>10</sup> 
Because of Your indignation and Your wrath; For You have lifted me up and cast me away. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My days are like a shadow that lengthens, And I wither away like grass. 

<sup>12</sup> 
But You, O Lord, shall endure forever, And the remembrance of Your name to all generations. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You will arise and have mercy on Zion; For the time to favor her, Yes, the set time, has come. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, And show favor to her dust. 

<sup>15</sup> 
So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord, And all the kings of the earth Your glory. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For the Lord shall build up Zion; He shall appear in His glory. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He shall regard the prayer of the destitute, And shall not despise their prayer. 

<sup>18</sup> 
This will be written for the generation to come, That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> 
For He looked down from the height of His sanctuary; From heaven the Lord viewed the earth, 

<sup>20</sup> 
To hear the groaning of the prisoner, To release those appointed to death, 

<sup>21</sup> 
To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, And His praise in Jerusalem, 

<sup>22</sup> 
When the peoples are gathered together, And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days. 

<sup>24</sup> 
I said, "O my God, Do not take me away in the midst of my days; Your years are throughout all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Of old You laid the foundation of the earth, And the heavens are the work of Your hands. 

<sup>26</sup> 
They will perish, but You will endure; Yes, they will all grow old like a garment; Like a cloak You will change them, And they will be changed. 

<sup>27</sup> 
But You are the same, And Your years will have no end. 

<sup>28</sup> 
The children of Your servants will continue, And their descendants will be established before You."
