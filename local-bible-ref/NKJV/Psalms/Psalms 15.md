<sup>1</sup> 
Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill? 

<sup>2</sup> 
He who walks uprightly, And works righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart; 

<sup>3</sup> 
He who does not backbite with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend; 

<sup>4</sup> 
In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honors those who fear the Lord; He who swears to his own hurt and does not change; 

<sup>5</sup> 
He who does not put out his money at usury, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
