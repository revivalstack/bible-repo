<sup>1</sup> 
Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes look to the Lord our God, Until He has mercy on us. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scorn of those who are at ease, With the contempt of the proud.
