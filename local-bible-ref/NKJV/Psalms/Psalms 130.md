<sup>1</sup> 
Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord; 

<sup>2</sup> 
Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>3</sup> 
If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 

<sup>4</sup> 
But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope. 

<sup>6</sup> 
My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning-- Yes, more than those who watch for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> 
O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
