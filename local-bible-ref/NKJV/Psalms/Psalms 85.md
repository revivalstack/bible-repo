Lord, You have been favorable to Your land; You have brought back the captivity of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> 
You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people; You have covered all their sin. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> 
You have taken away all Your wrath; You have turned from the fierceness of Your anger. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Restore us, O God of our salvation, And cause Your anger toward us to cease. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger to all generations? 

<sup>6</sup> 
Will You not revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You? 

<sup>7</sup> 
Show us Your mercy, Lord, And grant us Your salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I will hear what God the Lord will speak, For He will speak peace To His people and to His saints; But let them not turn back to folly. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, That glory may dwell in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Mercy and truth have met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Truth shall spring out of the earth, And righteousness shall look down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Yes, the Lord will give what is good; And our land will yield its increase. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Righteousness will go before Him, And shall make His footsteps our pathway.
