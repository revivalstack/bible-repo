<sup>1</sup> 
Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord my God, You are very great: You are clothed with honor and majesty, 

<sup>2</sup> 
Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment, Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters, Who makes the clouds His chariot, Who walks on the wings of the wind, 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who makes His angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You who laid the foundations of the earth, So that it should not be moved forever, 

<sup>6</sup> 
You covered it with the deep as with a garment; The waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> 
At Your rebuke they fled; At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They went up over the mountains; They went down into the valleys, To the place which You founded for them. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You have set a boundary that they may not pass over, That they may not return to cover the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He sends the springs into the valleys; They flow among the hills. 

<sup>11</sup> 
They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild donkeys quench their thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> 
By them the birds of the heavens have their home; They sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He waters the hills from His upper chambers; The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the service of man, That he may bring forth food from the earth, 

<sup>15</sup> 
And wine that makes glad the heart of man, Oil to make his face shine, And bread which strengthens man's heart. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The trees of the Lord are full of sap, The cedars of Lebanon which He planted, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Where the birds make their nests; The stork has her home in the fir trees. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The high hills are for the wild goats; The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He appointed the moon for seasons; The sun knows its going down. 

<sup>20</sup> 
You make darkness, and it is night, In which all the beasts of the forest creep about. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God. 

<sup>22</sup> 
When the sun rises, they gather together And lie down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Man goes out to his work And to his labor until the evening. 

<sup>24</sup> 
O Lord, how manifold are Your works! In wisdom You have made them all. The earth is full of Your possessions-- 

<sup>25</sup> 
This great and wide sea, In which are innumerable teeming things, Living things both small and great. 

<sup>26</sup> 
There the ships sail about; There is that Leviathan Which You have made to play there. 

<sup>27</sup> 
These all wait for You, That You may give them their food in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> 
What You give them they gather in; You open Your hand, they are filled with good. 

<sup>29</sup> 
You hide Your face, they are troubled; You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. 

<sup>30</sup> 
You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew the face of the earth. 

<sup>31</sup> 
May the glory of the Lord endure forever; May the Lord rejoice in His works. 

<sup>32</sup> 
He looks on the earth, and it trembles; He touches the hills, and they smoke. 

<sup>33</sup> 
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>34</sup> 
May my meditation be sweet to Him; I will be glad in the Lord. 

<sup>35</sup> 
May sinners be consumed from the earth, And the wicked be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord!
