O God, You have cast us off; You have broken us down; You have been displeased; Oh, restore us again! 

<sup>2</sup> 
You have made the earth tremble; You have broken it; Heal its breaches, for it is shaking. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You have shown Your people hard things; You have made us drink the wine of confusion. 

<sup>4</sup> 
You have given a banner to those who fear You, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and hear me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem And measure out the Valley of Succoth. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet for My head; Judah is My lawgiver. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Moab is My washpot; Over Edom I will cast My shoe; Philistia, shout in triumph because of Me." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Who will bring me to the strong city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Is it not You, O God, who cast us off? And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Give us help from trouble, For the help of man is useless. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Through God we will do valiantly, For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.
