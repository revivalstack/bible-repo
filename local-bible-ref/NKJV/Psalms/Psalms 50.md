The Mighty One, God the Lord, Has spoken and called the earth From the rising of the sun to its going down. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God will shine forth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent; A fire shall devour before Him, And it shall be very tempestuous all around Him. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He shall call to the heavens from above, And to the earth, that He may judge His people: 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Gather My saints together to Me, Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is Judge. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Hear, O My people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you; I am God, your God! 

<sup>8</sup> 
I will not rebuke you for your sacrifices Or your burnt offerings, Which are continually before Me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will not take a bull from your house, Nor goats out of your folds. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For every beast of the forest is Mine, And the cattle on a thousand hills. 

<sup>11</sup> 
I know all the birds of the mountains, And the wild beasts of the field are Mine. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"If I were hungry, I would not tell you; For the world is Mine, and all its fullness. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats? 

<sup>14</sup> 
Offer to God thanksgiving, And pay your vows to the Most High. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me." 

<sup>16</sup> 
But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to declare My statutes, Or take My covenant in your mouth, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Seeing you hate instruction And cast My words behind you? 

<sup>18</sup> 
When you saw a thief, you consented with him, And have been a partaker with adulterers. 

<sup>19</sup> 
You give your mouth to evil, And your tongue frames deceit. 

<sup>20</sup> 
You sit and speak against your brother; You slander your own mother's son. 

<sup>21</sup> 
These things you have done, and I kept silent; You thought that I was altogether like you; But I will rebuke you, And set them in order before your eyes. 

<sup>22</sup> 
"Now consider this, you who forget God, Lest I tear you in pieces, And there be none to deliver: 

<sup>23</sup> 
Whoever offers praise glorifies Me; And to him who orders his conduct aright I will show the salvation of God."
