God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods. 

<sup>2</sup> 
How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked? Selah 

<sup>3</sup> 
Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Deliver the poor and needy; Free them from the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They do not know, nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are unstable. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I said, "You are gods, And all of you are children of the Most High. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But you shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes." 

<sup>8</sup> 
Arise, O God, judge the earth; For You shall inherit all nations.
