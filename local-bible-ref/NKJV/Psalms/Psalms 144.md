<sup>1</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord my Rock, Who trains my hands for war, And my fingers for battle-- 

<sup>2</sup> 
My lovingkindness and my fortress, My high tower and my deliverer, My shield and the One in whom I take refuge, Who subdues my people under me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Man is like a breath; His days are like a passing shadow. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Bow down Your heavens, O Lord, and come down; Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Flash forth lightning and scatter them; Shoot out Your arrows and destroy them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Stretch out Your hand from above; Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, From the hand of foreigners, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Whose mouth speaks lying words, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will sing a new song to You, O God; On a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You, 

<sup>10</sup> 
The One who gives salvation to kings, Who delivers David His servant From the deadly sword. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, Whose mouth speaks lying words, And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood-- 

<sup>12</sup> 
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; That our daughters may be as pillars, Sculptured in palace style; 

<sup>13</sup> 
That our barns may be full, Supplying all kinds of produce; That our sheep may bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields; 

<sup>14</sup> 
That our oxen may be well laden; That there be no breaking in or going out; That there be no outcry in our streets. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Happy are the people who are in such a state; Happy are the people whose God is the Lord!
