Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens; Praise Him in the heights! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His hosts! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Praise Him, sun and moon; Praise Him, all you stars of light! 

<sup>4</sup> 
Praise Him, you heavens of heavens, And you waters above the heavens! 

<sup>5</sup> 
Let them praise the name of the Lord, For He commanded and they were created. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He also established them forever and ever; He made a decree which shall not pass away. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Praise the Lord from the earth, You great sea creatures and all the depths; 

<sup>8</sup> 
Fire and hail, snow and clouds; Stormy wind, fulfilling His word; 

<sup>9</sup> 
Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars; 

<sup>10</sup> 
Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying fowl; 

<sup>11</sup> 
Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth; 

<sup>12</sup> 
Both young men and maidens; Old men and children. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Let them praise the name of the Lord, For His name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and heaven. 

<sup>14</sup> 
And He has exalted the horn of His people, The praise of all His saints-- Of the children of Israel, A people near to Him. Praise the Lord!
