<sup>1</sup> 
In the Lord I put my trust; How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain"? 

<sup>2</sup> 
For look! The wicked bend their bow, They make ready their arrow on the string, That they may shoot secretly at the upright in heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 
If the foundations are destroyed, What can the righteous do? 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord is in His holy temple, The Lord's throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids test the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The Lord tests the righteous, But the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Upon the wicked He will rain coals; Fire and brimstone and a burning wind Shall be the portion of their cup. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For the Lord is righteous, He loves righteousness; His countenance beholds the upright.
