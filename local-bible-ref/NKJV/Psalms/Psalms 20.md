May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble; May the name of the God of Jacob defend you; 

<sup>2</sup> 
May He send you help from the sanctuary, And strengthen you out of Zion; 

<sup>3</sup> 
May He remember all your offerings, And accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> 
May He grant you according to your heart's desire, And fulfill all your purpose. 

<sup>5</sup> 
We will rejoice in your salvation, And in the name of our God we will set up our banners! May the Lord fulfill all your petitions. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven With the saving strength of His right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the Lord our God. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stand upright. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Save, Lord! May the King answer us when we call.
