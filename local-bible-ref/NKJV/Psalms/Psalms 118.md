<sup>1</sup> 
Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let Israel now say, "His mercy endures forever." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let the house of Aaron now say, "His mercy endures forever." 

<sup>4</sup> 
Let those who fear the Lord now say, "His mercy endures forever." 

<sup>5</sup> 
I called on the Lord in distress; The Lord answered me and set me in a broad place. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? 

<sup>7</sup> 
The Lord is for me among those who help me; Therefore I shall see my desire on those who hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
It is better to trust in the Lord Than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> 
It is better to trust in the Lord Than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> 
All nations surrounded me, But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 

<sup>11</sup> 
They surrounded me, Yes, they surrounded me; But in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
They surrounded me like bees; They were quenched like a fire of thorns; For in the name of the Lord I will destroy them. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You pushed me violently, that I might fall, But the Lord helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The Lord is my strength and song, And He has become my salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The voice of rejoicing and salvation Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The right hand of the Lord is exalted; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I shall not die, but live, And declare the works of the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The Lord has chastened me severely, But He has not given me over to death. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go through them, And I will praise the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> 
This is the gate of the Lord, Through which the righteous shall enter. 

<sup>21</sup> 
I will praise You, For You have answered me, And have become my salvation. 

<sup>22</sup> 
The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone. 

<sup>23</sup> 
This was the Lord's doing; It is marvelous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> 
This is the day the Lord has made; We will rejoice and be glad in it. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Save now, I pray, O Lord; O Lord, I pray, send now prosperity. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! We have blessed you from the house of the Lord. 

<sup>27</sup> 
God is the Lord, And He has given us light; Bind the sacrifice with cords to the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> 
You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I will exalt You. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever.
