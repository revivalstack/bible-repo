<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? Who can declare all His praise? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Blessed are those who keep justice, And he who does righteousness at all times! 

<sup>4</sup> 
Remember me, O Lord, with the favor You have toward Your people. Oh, visit me with Your salvation, 

<sup>5</sup> 
That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, That I may glory with Your inheritance. 

<sup>6</sup> 
We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, We have done wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders; They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies, But rebelled by the sea--the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake, That He might make His mighty power known. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up; So He led them through the depths, As through the wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The waters covered their enemies; There was not one of them left. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Then they believed His words; They sang His praise. 

<sup>13</sup> 
They soon forgot His works; They did not wait for His counsel, 

<sup>14</sup> 
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tested God in the desert. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And He gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul. 

<sup>16</sup> 
When they envied Moses in the camp, And Aaron the saint of the Lord, 

<sup>17</sup> 
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan, And covered the faction of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> 
A fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> 
They made a calf in Horeb, And worshiped the molded image. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Thus they changed their glory Into the image of an ox that eats grass. 

<sup>21</sup> 
They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt, 

<sup>22</sup> 
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, Awesome things by the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Therefore He said that He would destroy them, Had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach, To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy them. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Then they despised the pleasant land; They did not believe His word, 

<sup>25</sup> 
But complained in their tents, And did not heed the voice of the Lord. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Therefore He raised His hand in an oath against them, To overthrow them in the wilderness, 

<sup>27</sup> 
To overthrow their descendants among the nations, And to scatter them in the lands. 

<sup>28</sup> 
They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor, And ate sacrifices made to the dead. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds, And the plague broke out among them. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, And the plague was stopped. 

<sup>31</sup> 
And that was accounted to him for righteousness To all generations forevermore. 

<sup>32</sup> 
They angered Him also at the waters of strife, So that it went ill with Moses on account of them; 

<sup>33</sup> 
Because they rebelled against His Spirit, So that he spoke rashly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> 
They did not destroy the peoples, Concerning whom the Lord had commanded them, 

<sup>35</sup> 
But they mingled with the Gentiles And learned their works; 

<sup>36</sup> 
They served their idols, Which became a snare to them. 

<sup>37</sup> 
They even sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons, 

<sup>38</sup> 
And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood. 

<sup>39</sup> 
Thus they were defiled by their own works, And played the harlot by their own deeds. 

<sup>40</sup> 
Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against His people, So that He abhorred His own inheritance. 

<sup>41</sup> 
And He gave them into the hand of the Gentiles, And those who hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> 
Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand. 

<sup>43</sup> 
Many times He delivered them; But they rebelled in their counsel, And were brought low for their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> 
Nevertheless He regarded their affliction, When He heard their cry; 

<sup>45</sup> 
And for their sake He remembered His covenant, And relented according to the multitude of His mercies. 

<sup>46</sup> 
He also made them to be pitied By all those who carried them away captive. 

<sup>47</sup> 
Save us, O Lord our God, And gather us from among the Gentiles, To give thanks to Your holy name, To triumph in Your praise. 

<sup>48</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the Lord!
