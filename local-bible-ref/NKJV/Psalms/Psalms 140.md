<sup>1</sup> 
Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men, 

<sup>2</sup> 
Who plan evil things in their hearts; They continually gather together for war. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of asps is under their lips. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> 
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to make my steps stumble. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set traps for me. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> 
I said to the Lord: "You are my God; Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 
O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; Do not further his wicked scheme, Lest they be exalted. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> 
"As for the head of those who surround me, Let the evil of their lips cover them; 

<sup>10</sup> 
Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him." 

<sup>12</sup> 
I know that the Lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; The upright shall dwell in Your presence.
