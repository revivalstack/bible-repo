<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song, And His praise in the assembly of saints. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let them praise His name with the dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Let the saints be joyful in glory; Let them sing aloud on their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand, 

<sup>7</sup> 
To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments on the peoples; 

<sup>8</sup> 
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron; 

<sup>9</sup> 
To execute on them the written judgment-- This honor have all His saints. Praise the Lord!
