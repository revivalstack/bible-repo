"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth," Let Israel now say-- 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth; Yet they have not prevailed against me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The plowers plowed on my back; They made their furrows long." 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord is righteous; He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up, 

<sup>7</sup> 
With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Neither let those who pass by them say, "The blessing of the Lord be upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord!"
