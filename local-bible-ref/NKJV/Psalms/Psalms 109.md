<sup>1</sup> 
Do not keep silent, O God of my praise! 

<sup>2</sup> 
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful Have opened against me; They have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, And fought against me without a cause. 

<sup>4</sup> 
In return for my love they are my accusers, But I give myself to prayer. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Thus they have rewarded me evil for good, And hatred for my love. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Set a wicked man over him, And let an accuser stand at his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> 
When he is judged, let him be found guilty, And let his prayer become sin. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Let his days be few, And let another take his office. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg; Let them seek their bread also from their desolate places. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let the creditor seize all that he has, And let strangers plunder his labor. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Let there be none to extend mercy to him, Nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Let his posterity be cut off, And in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Let them be continually before the Lord, That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth; 

<sup>16</sup> 
Because he did not remember to show mercy, But persecuted the poor and needy man, That he might even slay the broken in heart. 

<sup>17</sup> 
As he loved cursing, so let it come to him; As he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him. 

<sup>18</sup> 
As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment, So let it enter his body like water, And like oil into his bones. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Let it be to him like the garment which covers him, And for a belt with which he girds himself continually. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Let this be the Lord's reward to my accusers, And to those who speak evil against my person. 

<sup>21</sup> 
But You, O God the Lord, Deal with me for Your name's sake; Because Your mercy is good, deliver me. 

<sup>22</sup> 
For I am poor and needy, And my heart is wounded within me. 

<sup>23</sup> 
I am gone like a shadow when it lengthens; I am shaken off like a locust. 

<sup>24</sup> 
My knees are weak through fasting, And my flesh is feeble from lack of fatness. 

<sup>25</sup> 
I also have become a reproach to them; When they look at me, they shake their heads. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Help me, O Lord my God! Oh, save me according to Your mercy, 

<sup>27</sup> 
That they may know that this is Your hand-- That You, Lord, have done it! 

<sup>28</sup> 
Let them curse, but You bless; When they arise, let them be ashamed, But let Your servant rejoice. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Let my accusers be clothed with shame, And let them cover themselves with their own disgrace as with a mantle. 

<sup>30</sup> 
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth; Yes, I will praise Him among the multitude. 

<sup>31</sup> 
For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor, To save him from those who condemn him.
