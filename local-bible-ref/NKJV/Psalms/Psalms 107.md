<sup>1</sup> 
Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy, 

<sup>3</sup> 
And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way; They found no city to dwell in. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, And He delivered them out of their distresses. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And He led them forth by the right way, That they might go to a city for a dwelling place. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> 
For He satisfies the longing soul, And fills the hungry soul with goodness. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Bound in affliction and irons-- 

<sup>11</sup> 
Because they rebelled against the words of God, And despised the counsel of the Most High, 

<sup>12</sup> 
Therefore He brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, And He saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their chains in pieces. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> 
For He has broken the gates of bronze, And cut the bars of iron in two. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Fools, because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, were afflicted. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Their soul abhorred all manner of food, And they drew near to the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, And He saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>20</sup> 
He sent His word and healed them, And delivered them from their destructions. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> 
Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare His works with rejoicing. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Those who go down to the sea in ships, Who do business on great waters, 

<sup>24</sup> 
They see the works of the Lord, And His wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> 
For He commands and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up the waves of the sea. 

<sup>26</sup> 
They mount up to the heavens, They go down again to the depths; Their soul melts because of trouble. 

<sup>27</sup> 
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits' end. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Then they cry out to the Lord in their trouble, And He brings them out of their distresses. 

<sup>29</sup> 
He calms the storm, So that its waves are still. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Then they are glad because they are quiet; So He guides them to their desired haven. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness, And for His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> 
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people, And praise Him in the company of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> 
He turns rivers into a wilderness, And the watersprings into dry ground; 

<sup>34</sup> 
A fruitful land into barrenness, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it. 

<sup>35</sup> 
He turns a wilderness into pools of water, And dry land into watersprings. 

<sup>36</sup> 
There He makes the hungry dwell, That they may establish a city for a dwelling place, 

<sup>37</sup> 
And sow fields and plant vineyards, That they may yield a fruitful harvest. 

<sup>38</sup> 
He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly; And He does not let their cattle decrease. 

<sup>39</sup> 
When they are diminished and brought low Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow, 

<sup>40</sup> 
He pours contempt on princes, And causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way; 

<sup>41</sup> 
Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction, And makes their families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> 
The righteous see it and rejoice, And all iniquity stops its mouth. 

<sup>43</sup> 
Whoever is wise will observe these things, And they will understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.
