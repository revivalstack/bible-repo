<sup>1</sup> 
Why do You stand afar off, O Lord? Why do You hide in times of trouble? 

<sup>2</sup> 
The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor; Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire; He blesses the greedy and renounces the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God; God is in none of his thoughts. 

<sup>5</sup> 
His ways are always prospering; Your judgments are far above, out of his sight; As for all his enemies, he sneers at them. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He has said in his heart, "I shall not be moved; I shall never be in adversity." 

<sup>7</sup> 
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; Under his tongue is trouble and iniquity. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He sits in the lurking places of the villages; In the secret places he murders the innocent; His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; He lies in wait to catch the poor; He catches the poor when he draws him into his net. 

<sup>10</sup> 
So he crouches, he lies low, That the helpless may fall by his strength. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He has said in his heart, "God has forgotten; He hides His face; He will never see." 

<sup>12</sup> 
Arise, O Lord! O God, lift up Your hand! Do not forget the humble. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Why do the wicked renounce God? He has said in his heart, "You will not require an account." 

<sup>14</sup> 
But You have seen, for You observe trouble and grief, To repay it by Your hand. The helpless commits himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man; Seek out his wickedness until You find none. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The Lord is King forever and ever; The nations have perished out of His land. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will prepare their heart; You will cause Your ear to hear, 

<sup>18</sup> 
To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, That the man of the earth may oppress no more.
