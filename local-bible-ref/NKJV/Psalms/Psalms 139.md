<sup>1</sup> 
O Lord, You have searched me and known me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You comprehend my path and my lying down, And are acquainted with all my ways. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For there is not a word on my tongue, But behold, O Lord, You know it altogether. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? 

<sup>8</sup> 
If I ascend into heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there. 

<sup>9</sup> 
If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, 

<sup>10</sup> 
Even there Your hand shall lead me, And Your right hand shall hold me. 

<sup>11</sup> 
If I say, "Surely the darkness shall fall on me," Even the night shall be light about me; 

<sup>12</sup> 
Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light are both alike to You. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother's womb. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, And that my soul knows very well. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, When as yet there were none of them. 

<sup>17</sup> 
How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them! 

<sup>18</sup> 
If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand; When I awake, I am still with You. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Oh, that You would slay the wicked, O God! Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men. 

<sup>20</sup> 
For they speak against You wickedly; Your enemies take Your name in vain. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Do I not hate them, O Lord, who hate You? And do I not loathe those who rise up against You? 

<sup>22</sup> 
I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties; 

<sup>24</sup> 
And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting.
