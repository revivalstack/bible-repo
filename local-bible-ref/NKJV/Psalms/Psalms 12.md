Help, Lord, for the godly man ceases! For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men. 

<sup>2</sup> 
They speak idly everyone with his neighbor; With flattering lips and a double heart they speak. 

<sup>3</sup> 
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, And the tongue that speaks proud things, 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail; Our lips are our own; Who is lord over us?" 

<sup>5</sup> 
"For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, Now I will arise," says the Lord; "I will set him in the safety for which he yearns." 

<sup>6</sup> 
The words of the Lord are pure words, Like silver tried in a furnace of earth, Purified seven times. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You shall keep them, O Lord, You shall preserve them from this generation forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The wicked prowl on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
