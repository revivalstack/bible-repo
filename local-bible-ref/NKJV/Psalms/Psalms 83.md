Do not keep silent, O God! Do not hold Your peace, And do not be still, O God! 

<sup>2</sup> 
For behold, Your enemies make a tumult; And those who hate You have lifted up their head. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They have taken crafty counsel against Your people, And consulted together against Your sheltered ones. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They have said, "Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more." 

<sup>5</sup> 
For they have consulted together with one consent; They form a confederacy against You: 

<sup>6</sup> 
The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagrites; 

<sup>7</sup> 
Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 

<sup>8</sup> 
Assyria also has joined with them; They have helped the children of Lot. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> 
Deal with them as with Midian, As with Sisera, As with Jabin at the Brook Kishon, 

<sup>10</sup> 
Who perished at En Dor, Who became as refuse on the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb, Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

<sup>12</sup> 
Who said, "Let us take for ourselves The pastures of God for a possession." 

<sup>13</sup> 
O my God, make them like the whirling dust, Like the chaff before the wind! 

<sup>14</sup> 
As the fire burns the woods, And as the flame sets the mountains on fire, 

<sup>15</sup> 
So pursue them with Your tempest, And frighten them with Your storm. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Fill their faces with shame, That they may seek Your name, O Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Let them be confounded and dismayed forever; Yes, let them be put to shame and perish, 

<sup>18</sup> 
That they may know that You, whose name alone is the Lord, Are the Most High over all the earth.
