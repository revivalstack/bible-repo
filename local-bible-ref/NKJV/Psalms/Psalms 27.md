<sup>1</sup> 
The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid? 

<sup>2</sup> 
When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh, My enemies and foes, They stumbled and fell. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Though an army may encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war may rise against me, In this I will be confident. 

<sup>4</sup> 
One thing I have desired of the Lord, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord, And to inquire in His temple. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me; Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice! Have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
When You said, "Seek My face," My heart said to You, "Your face, Lord, I will seek." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Do not hide Your face from me; Do not turn Your servant away in anger; You have been my help; Do not leave me nor forsake me, O God of my salvation. 

<sup>10</sup> 
When my father and my mother forsake me, Then the Lord will take care of me. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Teach me Your way, O Lord, And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries; For false witnesses have risen against me, And such as breathe out violence. 

<sup>13</sup> 
I would have lost heart, unless I had believed That I would see the goodness of the Lord In the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Wait on the Lord; Be of good courage, And He shall strengthen your heart; Wait, I say, on the Lord!
