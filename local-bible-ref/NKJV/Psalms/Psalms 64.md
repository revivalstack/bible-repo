<sup>1</sup> 
Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation; Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity, 

<sup>3</sup> 
Who sharpen their tongue like a sword, And bend their bows to shoot their arrows--bitter words, 

<sup>4</sup> 
That they may shoot in secret at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They encourage themselves in an evil matter; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who will see them?" 

<sup>6</sup> 
They devise iniquities: "We have perfected a shrewd scheme." Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they shall be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> 
So He will make them stumble over their own tongue; All who see them shall flee away. 

<sup>9</sup> 
All men shall fear, And shall declare the work of God; For they shall wisely consider His doing. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in Him. And all the upright in heart shall glory.
