<sup>1</sup> 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You who lead Joseph like a flock; You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, Stir up Your strength, And come and save us! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Restore us, O God; Cause Your face to shine, And we shall be saved! 

<sup>4</sup> 
O Lord God of hosts, How long will You be angry Against the prayer of Your people? 

<sup>5</sup> 
You have fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in great measure. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You have made us a strife to our neighbors, And our enemies laugh among themselves. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Restore us, O God of hosts; Cause Your face to shine, And we shall be saved! 

<sup>8</sup> 
You have brought a vine out of Egypt; You have cast out the nations, and planted it. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You prepared room for it, And caused it to take deep root, And it filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The hills were covered with its shadow, And the mighty cedars with its boughs. 

<sup>11</sup> 
She sent out her boughs to the Sea, And her branches to the River. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Why have You broken down her hedges, So that all who pass by the way pluck her fruit? 

<sup>13</sup> 
The boar out of the woods uproots it, And the wild beast of the field devours it. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Return, we beseech You, O God of hosts; Look down from heaven and see, And visit this vine 

<sup>15</sup> 
And the vineyard which Your right hand has planted, And the branch that You made strong for Yourself. 

<sup>16</sup> 
It is burned with fire, it is cut down; They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Then we will not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Restore us, O Lord God of hosts; Cause Your face to shine, And we shall be saved!
