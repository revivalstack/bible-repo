<sup>1</sup> 
Do you indeed speak righteousness, you silent ones? Do you judge uprightly, you sons of men? 

<sup>2</sup> 
No, in heart you work wickedness; You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The wicked are estranged from the womb; They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent; They are like the deaf cobra that stops its ear, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Which will not heed the voice of charmers, Charming ever so skillfully. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Break their teeth in their mouth, O God! Break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord! 

<sup>7</sup> 
Let them flow away as waters which run continually; When he bends his bow, Let his arrows be as if cut in pieces. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Let them be like a snail which melts away as it goes, Like a stillborn child of a woman, that they may not see the sun. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Before your pots can feel the burning thorns, He shall take them away as with a whirlwind, As in His living and burning wrath. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, 

<sup>11</sup> 
So that men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely He is God who judges in the earth."
