We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, The deeds You did in their days, In days of old: 

<sup>2</sup> 
You drove out the nations with Your hand, But them You planted; You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword, Nor did their own arm save them; But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance, Because You favored them. 

<sup>4</sup> 
You are my King, O God; Command victories for Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Through You we will push down our enemies; Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For I will not trust in my bow, Nor shall my sword save me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But You have saved us from our enemies, And have put to shame those who hated us. 

<sup>8</sup> 
In God we boast all day long, And praise Your name forever. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> 
But You have cast us off and put us to shame, And You do not go out with our armies. 

<sup>10</sup> 
You make us turn back from the enemy, And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves. 

<sup>11</sup> 
You have given us up like sheep intended for food, And have scattered us among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> 
You sell Your people for next to nothing, And are not enriched by selling them. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scorn and a derision to those all around us. 

<sup>14</sup> 
You make us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My dishonor is continually before me, And the shame of my face has covered me, 

<sup>16</sup> 
Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles, Because of the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>17</sup> 
All this has come upon us; But we have not forgotten You, Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Our heart has not turned back, Nor have our steps departed from Your way; 

<sup>19</sup> 
But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death. 

<sup>20</sup> 
If we had forgotten the name of our God, Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god, 

<sup>21</sup> 
Would not God search this out? For He knows the secrets of the heart. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arise! Do not cast us off forever. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Why do You hide Your face, And forget our affliction and our oppression? 

<sup>25</sup> 
For our soul is bowed down to the dust; Our body clings to the ground. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Arise for our help, And redeem us for Your mercies' sake.
