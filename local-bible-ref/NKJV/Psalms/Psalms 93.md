<sup>1</sup> 
The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength. Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The floods have lifted up, O Lord, The floods have lifted up their voice; The floods lift up their waves. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters, Than the mighty waves of the sea. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Your testimonies are very sure; Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord, forever.
