<sup>1</sup> 
Give ear, O my people, to my law; Incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old, 

<sup>3</sup> 
Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us. 

<sup>4</sup> 
We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, And His strength and His wonderful works that He has done. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For He established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which He commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children; 

<sup>6</sup> 
That the generation to come might know them, The children who would be born, That they may arise and declare them to their children, 

<sup>7</sup> 
That they may set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep His commandments; 

<sup>8</sup> 
And may not be like their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that did not set its heart aright, And whose spirit was not faithful to God. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle. 

<sup>10</sup> 
They did not keep the covenant of God; They refused to walk in His law, 

<sup>11</sup> 
And forgot His works And His wonders that He had shown them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Marvelous things He did in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through; And He made the waters stand up like a heap. 

<sup>14</sup> 
In the daytime also He led them with the cloud, And all the night with a light of fire. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He split the rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink in abundance like the depths. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He also brought streams out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers. 

<sup>17</sup> 
But they sinned even more against Him By rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness. 

<sup>18</sup> 
And they tested God in their heart By asking for the food of their fancy. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Yes, they spoke against God: They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Behold, He struck the rock, So that the waters gushed out, And the streams overflowed. Can He give bread also? Can He provide meat for His people?" 

<sup>21</sup> 
Therefore the Lord heard this and was furious; So a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also came up against Israel, 

<sup>22</sup> 
Because they did not believe in God, And did not trust in His salvation. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Yet He had commanded the clouds above, And opened the doors of heaven, 

<sup>24</sup> 
Had rained down manna on them to eat, And given them of the bread of heaven. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Men ate angels' food; He sent them food to the full. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens; And by His power He brought in the south wind. 

<sup>27</sup> 
He also rained meat on them like the dust, Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas; 

<sup>28</sup> 
And He let them fall in the midst of their camp, All around their dwellings. 

<sup>29</sup> 
So they ate and were well filled, For He gave them their own desire. 

<sup>30</sup> 
They were not deprived of their craving; But while their food was still in their mouths, 

<sup>31</sup> 
The wrath of God came against them, And slew the stoutest of them, And struck down the choice men of Israel. 

<sup>32</sup> 
In spite of this they still sinned, And did not believe in His wondrous works. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Therefore their days He consumed in futility, And their years in fear. 

<sup>34</sup> 
When He slew them, then they sought Him; And they returned and sought earnestly for God. 

<sup>35</sup> 
Then they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their Redeemer. 

<sup>36</sup> 
Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth, And they lied to Him with their tongue; 

<sup>37</sup> 
For their heart was not steadfast with Him, Nor were they faithful in His covenant. 

<sup>38</sup> 
But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, And did not destroy them. Yes, many a time He turned His anger away, And did not stir up all His wrath; 

<sup>39</sup> 
For He remembered that they were but flesh, A breath that passes away and does not come again. 

<sup>40</sup> 
How often they provoked Him in the wilderness, And grieved Him in the desert! 

<sup>41</sup> 
Yes, again and again they tempted God, And limited the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>42</sup> 
They did not remember His power: The day when He redeemed them from the enemy, 

<sup>43</sup> 
When He worked His signs in Egypt, And His wonders in the field of Zoan; 

<sup>44</sup> 
Turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, that they could not drink. 

<sup>45</sup> 
He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them, And frogs, which destroyed them. 

<sup>46</sup> 
He also gave their crops to the caterpillar, And their labor to the locust. 

<sup>47</sup> 
He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycamore trees with frost. 

<sup>48</sup> 
He also gave up their cattle to the hail, And their flocks to fiery lightning. 

<sup>49</sup> 
He cast on them the fierceness of His anger, Wrath, indignation, and trouble, By sending angels of destruction among them. 

<sup>50</sup> 
He made a path for His anger; He did not spare their soul from death, But gave their life over to the plague, 

<sup>51</sup> 
And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt, The first of their strength in the tents of Ham. 

<sup>52</sup> 
But He made His own people go forth like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock; 

<sup>53</sup> 
And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

<sup>54</sup> 
And He brought them to His holy border, This mountain which His right hand had acquired. 

<sup>55</sup> 
He also drove out the nations before them, Allotted them an inheritance by survey, And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents. 

<sup>56</sup> 
Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God, And did not keep His testimonies, 

<sup>57</sup> 
But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers; They were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 

<sup>58</sup> 
For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images. 

<sup>59</sup> 
When God heard this, He was furious, And greatly abhorred Israel, 

<sup>60</sup> 
So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent He had placed among men, 

<sup>61</sup> 
And delivered His strength into captivity, And His glory into the enemy's hand. 

<sup>62</sup> 
He also gave His people over to the sword, And was furious with His inheritance. 

<sup>63</sup> 
The fire consumed their young men, And their maidens were not given in marriage. 

<sup>64</sup> 
Their priests fell by the sword, And their widows made no lamentation. 

<sup>65</sup> 
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine. 

<sup>66</sup> 
And He beat back His enemies; He put them to a perpetual reproach. 

<sup>67</sup> 
Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph, And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, 

<sup>68</sup> 
But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which He loved. 

<sup>69</sup> 
And He built His sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which He has established forever. 

<sup>70</sup> 
He also chose David His servant, And took him from the sheepfolds; 

<sup>71</sup> 
From following the ewes that had young He brought him, To shepherd Jacob His people, And Israel His inheritance. 

<sup>72</sup> 
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
