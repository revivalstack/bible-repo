<sup>1</sup> 
Hear my cry, O God; Attend to my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> 
From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For You have been a shelter for me, A strong tower from the enemy. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage of those who fear Your name. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You will prolong the king's life, His years as many generations. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him! 

<sup>8</sup> 
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.
