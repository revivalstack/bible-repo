<sup>1</sup> 
Vindicate me, O Lord, For I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in the Lord; I shall not slip. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; Try my mind and my heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your truth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I have not sat with idolatrous mortals, Nor will I go in with hypocrites. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I have hated the assembly of evildoers, And will not sit with the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I will wash my hands in innocence; So I will go about Your altar, O Lord, 

<sup>7</sup> 
That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving, And tell of all Your wondrous works. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Lord, I have loved the habitation of Your house, And the place where Your glory dwells. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Do not gather my soul with sinners, Nor my life with bloodthirsty men, 

<sup>10</sup> 
In whose hands is a sinister scheme, And whose right hand is full of bribes. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; Redeem me and be merciful to me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
My foot stands in an even place; In the congregations I will bless the Lord.
