<sup>1</sup> 
I will love You, O Lord, my strength. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer; My God, my strength, in whom I will trust; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; So shall I be saved from my enemies. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The pangs of death surrounded me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The sorrows of Sheol surrounded me; The snares of death confronted me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
In my distress I called upon the Lord, And cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry came before Him, even to His ears. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations of the hills also quaked and were shaken, Because He was angry. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Smoke went up from His nostrils, And devouring fire from His mouth; Coals were kindled by it. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He bowed the heavens also, and came down With darkness under His feet. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And He rode upon a cherub, and flew; He flew upon the wings of the wind. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He made darkness His secret place; His canopy around Him was dark waters And thick clouds of the skies. 

<sup>12</sup> 
From the brightness before Him, His thick clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The Lord thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered His voice, Hailstones and coals of fire. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He sent out His arrows and scattered the foe, Lightnings in abundance, and He vanquished them. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then the channels of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At Your rebuke, O Lord, At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He sent from above, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me, For they were too strong for me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
They confronted me in the day of my calamity, But the Lord was my support. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He also brought me out into a broad place; He delivered me because He delighted in me. 

<sup>20</sup> 
The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For I have kept the ways of the Lord, And have not wickedly departed from my God. 

<sup>22</sup> 
For all His judgments were before me, And I did not put away His statutes from me. 

<sup>23</sup> 
I was also blameless before Him, And I kept myself from my iniquity. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight. 

<sup>25</sup> 
With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless; 

<sup>26</sup> 
With the pure You will show Yourself pure; And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For You will save the humble people, But will bring down haughty looks. 

<sup>28</sup> 
For You will light my lamp; The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness. 

<sup>29</sup> 
For by You I can run against a troop, By my God I can leap over a wall. 

<sup>30</sup> 
As for God, His way is perfect; The word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him. 

<sup>31</sup> 
For who is God, except the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God? 

<sup>32</sup> 
It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect. 

<sup>33</sup> 
He makes my feet like the feet of deer, And sets me on my high places. 

<sup>34</sup> 
He teaches my hands to make war, So that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 

<sup>35</sup> 
You have also given me the shield of Your salvation; Your right hand has held me up, Your gentleness has made me great. 

<sup>36</sup> 
You enlarged my path under me, So my feet did not slip. 

<sup>37</sup> 
I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them; Neither did I turn back again till they were destroyed. 

<sup>38</sup> 
I have wounded them, So that they could not rise; They have fallen under my feet. 

<sup>39</sup> 
For You have armed me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. 

<sup>40</sup> 
You have also given me the necks of my enemies, So that I destroyed those who hated me. 

<sup>41</sup> 
They cried out, but there was none to save; Even to the Lord, but He did not answer them. 

<sup>42</sup> 
Then I beat them as fine as the dust before the wind; I cast them out like dirt in the streets. 

<sup>43</sup> 
You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You have made me the head of the nations; A people I have not known shall serve me. 

<sup>44</sup> 
As soon as they hear of me they obey me; The foreigners submit to me. 

<sup>45</sup> 
The foreigners fade away, And come frightened from their hideouts. 

<sup>46</sup> 
The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted. 

<sup>47</sup> 
It is God who avenges me, And subdues the peoples under me; 

<sup>48</sup> 
He delivers me from my enemies. You also lift me up above those who rise against me; You have delivered me from the violent man. 

<sup>49</sup> 
Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name. 

<sup>50</sup> 
Great deliverance He gives to His king, And shows mercy to His anointed, To David and his descendants forevermore.
