My heart is overflowing with a good theme; I recite my composition concerning the King; My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 

<sup>2</sup> 
You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; Therefore God has blessed You forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One, With Your glory and Your majesty. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, and righteousness; And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King's enemies; The peoples fall under You. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions. 

<sup>8</sup> 
All Your garments are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia, Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Kings' daughters are among Your honorable women; At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Listen, O daughter, Consider and incline your ear; Forget your own people also, and your father's house; 

<sup>11</sup> 
So the King will greatly desire your beauty; Because He is your Lord, worship Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; The rich among the people will seek your favor. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace; Her clothing is woven with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> 
She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors; The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to You. 

<sup>15</sup> 
With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought; They shall enter the King's palace. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, Whom You shall make princes in all the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.
