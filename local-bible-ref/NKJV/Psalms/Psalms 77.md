<sup>1</sup> 
I cried out to God with my voice-- To God with my voice; And He gave ear to me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; My hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing; My soul refused to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I remembered God, and was troubled; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> 
You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I call to remembrance my song in the night; I meditate within my heart, And my spirit makes diligent search. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more? 

<sup>8</sup> 
Has His mercy ceased forever? Has His promise failed forevermore? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah 

<sup>10</sup> 
And I said, "This is my anguish; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High." 

<sup>11</sup> 
I will remember the works of the Lord; Surely I will remember Your wonders of old. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I will also meditate on all Your work, And talk of Your deeds. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary; Who is so great a God as our God? 

<sup>14</sup> 
You are the God who does wonders; You have declared Your strength among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> 
You have with Your arm redeemed Your people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> 
The waters saw You, O God; The waters saw You, they were afraid; The depths also trembled. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound; Your arrows also flashed about. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters, And Your footsteps were not known. 

<sup>20</sup> 
You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron.
