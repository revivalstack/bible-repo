O God, You are my God; Early will I seek You; My soul thirsts for You; My flesh longs for You In a dry and thirsty land Where there is no water. 

<sup>2</sup> 
So I have looked for You in the sanctuary, To see Your power and Your glory. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life, My lips shall praise You. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Thus I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name. 

<sup>5</sup> 
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, And my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips. 

<sup>6</sup> 
When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Because You have been my help, Therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice. 

<sup>8</sup> 
My soul follows close behind You; Your right hand upholds me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
But those who seek my life, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
They shall fall by the sword; They shall be a portion for jackals. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But the king shall rejoice in God; Everyone who swears by Him shall glory; But the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
