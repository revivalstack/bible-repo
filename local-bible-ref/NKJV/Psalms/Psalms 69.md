<sup>1</sup> 
Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I sink in deep mire, Where there is no standing; I have come into deep waters, Where the floods overflow me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I am weary with my crying; My throat is dry; My eyes fail while I wait for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Those who hate me without a cause Are more than the hairs of my head; They are mighty who would destroy me, Being my enemies wrongfully; Though I have stolen nothing, I still must restore it. 

<sup>5</sup> 
O God, You know my foolishness; And my sins are not hidden from You. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let not those who wait for You, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because of me; Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me, O God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Because for Your sake I have borne reproach; Shame has covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I have become a stranger to my brothers, And an alien to my mother's children; 

<sup>9</sup> 
Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up, And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting, That became my reproach. 

<sup>11</sup> 
I also made sackcloth my garment; I became a byword to them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Those who sit in the gate speak against me, And I am the song of the drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Lord, in the acceptable time; O God, in the multitude of Your mercy, Hear me in the truth of Your salvation. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Deliver me out of the mire, And let me not sink; Let me be delivered from those who hate me, And out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Let not the floodwater overflow me, Nor let the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit shut its mouth on me. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Hear me, O Lord, for Your lovingkindness is good; Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And do not hide Your face from Your servant, For I am in trouble; Hear me speedily. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Draw near to my soul, and redeem it; Deliver me because of my enemies. 

<sup>19</sup> 
You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; My adversaries are all before You. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Reproach has broken my heart, And I am full of heaviness; I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none. 

<sup>21</sup> 
They also gave me gall for my food, And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Let their table become a snare before them, And their well-being a trap. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see; And make their loins shake continually. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Pour out Your indignation upon them, And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Let their dwelling place be desolate; Let no one live in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> 
For they persecute the ones You have struck, And talk of the grief of those You have wounded. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Add iniquity to their iniquity, And let them not come into Your righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, And not be written with the righteous. 

<sup>29</sup> 
But I am poor and sorrowful; Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high. 

<sup>30</sup> 
I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify Him with thanksgiving. 

<sup>31</sup> 
This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bull, Which has horns and hooves. 

<sup>32</sup> 
The humble shall see this and be glad; And you who seek God, your hearts shall live. 

<sup>33</sup> 
For the Lord hears the poor, And does not despise His prisoners. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Let heaven and earth praise Him, The seas and everything that moves in them. 

<sup>35</sup> 
For God will save Zion And build the cities of Judah, That they may dwell there and possess it. 

<sup>36</sup> 
Also, the descendants of His servants shall inherit it, And those who love His name shall dwell in it.
