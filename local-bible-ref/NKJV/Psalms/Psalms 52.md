<sup>1</sup> 
Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The goodness of God endures continually. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You love evil more than good, Lying rather than speaking righteousness. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> 
You love all devouring words, You deceitful tongue. 

<sup>5</sup> 
God shall likewise destroy you forever; He shall take you away, and pluck you out of your dwelling place, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> 
The righteous also shall see and fear, And shall laugh at him, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> 
"Here is the man who did not make God his strength, But trusted in the abundance of his riches, And strengthened himself in his wickedness." 

<sup>8</sup> 
But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will praise You forever, Because You have done it; And in the presence of Your saints I will wait on Your name, for it is good.
