<sup>1</sup> 
I love the Lord, because He has heard My voice and my supplications. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The pains of death surrounded me, And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then I called upon the name of the Lord: "O Lord, I implore You, deliver my soul!" 

<sup>5</sup> 
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Return to your rest, O my soul, For the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For You have delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, And my feet from falling. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will walk before the Lord In the land of the living. 

<sup>10</sup> 
I believed, therefore I spoke, "I am greatly afflicted." 

<sup>11</sup> 
I said in my haste, "All men are liars." 

<sup>12</sup> 
What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me? 

<sup>13</sup> 
I will take up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His saints. 

<sup>16</sup> 
O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 
I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people, 

<sup>19</sup> 
In the courts of the Lord's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord!
