<sup>1</sup> 
I will lift up my eyes to the hills-- From whence comes my help? 

<sup>2</sup> 
My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He will not allow your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Behold, He who keeps Israel Shall neither slumber nor sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The Lord is your keeper; The Lord is your shade at your right hand. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The sun shall not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; He shall preserve your soul. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in From this time forth, and even forevermore.
