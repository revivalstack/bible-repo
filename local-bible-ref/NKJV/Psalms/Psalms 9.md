<sup>1</sup> 
I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will tell of all Your marvelous works. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High. 

<sup>3</sup> 
When my enemies turn back, They shall fall and perish at Your presence. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging in righteousness. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name forever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> 
O enemy, destructions are finished forever! And you have destroyed cities; Even their memory has perished. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But the Lord shall endure forever; He has prepared His throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He shall judge the world in righteousness, And He shall administer judgment for the peoples in uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, A refuge in times of trouble. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; For You, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek You. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion! Declare His deeds among the people. 

<sup>12</sup> 
When He avenges blood, He remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the humble. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Have mercy on me, O Lord! Consider my trouble from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death, 

<sup>14</sup> 
That I may tell of all Your praise In the gates of the daughter of Zion. I will rejoice in Your salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The nations have sunk down in the pit which they made; In the net which they hid, their own foot is caught. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The Lord is known by the judgment He executes; The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Meditation. Selah 

<sup>17</sup> 
The wicked shall be turned into hell, And all the nations that forget God. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For the needy shall not always be forgotten; The expectation of the poor shall not perish forever. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Arise, O Lord, Do not let man prevail; Let the nations be judged in Your sight. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Put them in fear, O Lord, That the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah
