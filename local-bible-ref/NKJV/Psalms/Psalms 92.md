<sup>1</sup> 
It is good to give thanks to the Lord, And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High; 

<sup>2</sup> 
To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, And Your faithfulness every night, 

<sup>3</sup> 
On an instrument of ten strings, On the lute, And on the harp, With harmonious sound. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands. 

<sup>5</sup> 
O Lord, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep. 

<sup>6</sup> 
A senseless man does not know, Nor does a fool understand this. 

<sup>7</sup> 
When the wicked spring up like grass, And when all the workers of iniquity flourish, It is that they may be destroyed forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But You, Lord, are on high forevermore. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For behold, Your enemies, O Lord, For behold, Your enemies shall perish; All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But my horn You have exalted like a wild ox; I have been anointed with fresh oil. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My eye also has seen my desire on my enemies; My ears hear my desire on the wicked Who rise up against me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Those who are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing, 

<sup>15</sup> 
To declare that the Lord is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
