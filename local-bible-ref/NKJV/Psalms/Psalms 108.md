O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples, And I will sing praises to You among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For Your mercy is great above the heavens, And Your truth reaches to the clouds. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, And Your glory above all the earth; 

<sup>6</sup> 
That Your beloved may be delivered, Save with Your right hand, and hear me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
God has spoken in His holiness: "I will rejoice; I will divide Shechem And measure out the Valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is the helmet for My head; Judah is My lawgiver. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Moab is My washpot; Over Edom I will cast My shoe; Over Philistia I will triumph." 

<sup>10</sup> 
Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Is it not You, O God, who cast us off? And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Give us help from trouble, For the help of man is useless. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Through God we will do valiantly, For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.
