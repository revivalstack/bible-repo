<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Praise, O servants of the Lord, Praise the name of the Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Blessed be the name of the Lord From this time forth and forevermore! 

<sup>3</sup> 
From the rising of the sun to its going down The Lord's name is to be praised. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord is high above all nations, His glory above the heavens. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Who is like the Lord our God, Who dwells on high, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Who humbles Himself to behold The things that are in the heavens and in the earth? 

<sup>7</sup> 
He raises the poor out of the dust, And lifts the needy out of the ash heap, 

<sup>8</sup> 
That He may seat him with princes-- With the princes of His people. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He grants the barren woman a home, Like a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord!
