<sup>1</sup> 
Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous! For praise from the upright is beautiful. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Praise the Lord with the harp; Make melody to Him with an instrument of ten strings. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Sing to Him a new song; Play skillfully with a shout of joy. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For the word of the Lord is right, And all His work is done in truth. 

<sup>5</sup> 
He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 
By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He lays up the deep in storehouses. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Let all the earth fear the Lord; Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He makes the plans of the peoples of no effect. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The counsel of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen as His own inheritance. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The Lord looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men. 

<sup>14</sup> 
From the place of His dwelling He looks On all the inhabitants of the earth; 

<sup>15</sup> 
He fashions their hearts individually; He considers all their works. 

<sup>16</sup> 
No king is saved by the multitude of an army; A mighty man is not delivered by great strength. 

<sup>17</sup> 
A horse is a vain hope for safety; Neither shall it deliver any by its great strength. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, On those who hope in His mercy, 

<sup>19</sup> 
To deliver their soul from death, And to keep them alive in famine. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Our soul waits for the Lord; He is our help and our shield. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For our heart shall rejoice in Him, Because we have trusted in His holy name. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Let Your mercy, O Lord, be upon us, Just as we hope in You.
