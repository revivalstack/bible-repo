<sup>1</sup> 
Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! Sing to the Lord, all the earth. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Sing to the Lord, bless His name; Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the Lord made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Honor and majesty are before Him; Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Give to the Lord, O families of the peoples, Give to the Lord glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Give to the Lord the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Say among the nations, "The Lord reigns; The world also is firmly established, It shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously." 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; 

<sup>12</sup> 
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice 

<sup>13</sup> 
before the Lord. For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.
