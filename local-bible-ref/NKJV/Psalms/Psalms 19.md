The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Day unto day utters speech, And night unto night reveals knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> 
There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world. In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, And rejoices like a strong man to run its race. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Its rising is from one end of heaven, And its circuit to the other end; And there is nothing hidden from its heat. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple; 

<sup>8</sup> 
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes; 

<sup>9</sup> 
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. 

<sup>10</sup> 
More to be desired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Moreover by them Your servant is warned, And in keeping them there is great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from secret faults. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; Let them not have dominion over me. Then I shall be blameless, And I shall be innocent of great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.
