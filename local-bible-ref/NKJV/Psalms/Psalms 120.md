<sup>1</sup> 
In my distress I cried to the Lord, And He heard me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips And from a deceitful tongue. 

<sup>3</sup> 
What shall be given to you, Or what shall be done to you, You false tongue? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Sharp arrows of the warrior, With coals of the broom tree! 

<sup>5</sup> 
Woe is me, that I dwell in Meshech, That I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

<sup>6</sup> 
My soul has dwelt too long With one who hates peace. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I am for peace; But when I speak, they are for war.
