<sup>1</sup> 
Preserve me, O God, for in You I put my trust. 

<sup>2</sup> 
O my soul, you have said to the Lord, "You are my Lord, My goodness is nothing apart from You." 

<sup>3</sup> 
As for the saints who are on the earth, "They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight." 

<sup>4</sup> 
Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god; Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, Nor take up their names on my lips. 

<sup>5</sup> 
O Lord, You are the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You maintain my lot. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Yes, I have a good inheritance. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel; My heart also instructs me in the night seasons. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I have set the Lord always before me; Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will rest in hope. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption. 

<sup>11</sup> 
You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
