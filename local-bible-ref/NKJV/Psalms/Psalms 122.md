I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." 

<sup>2</sup> 
Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Jerusalem is built As a city that is compact together, 

<sup>4</sup> 
Where the tribes go up, The tribes of the Lord, To the Testimony of Israel, To give thanks to the name of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For thrones are set there for judgment, The thrones of the house of David. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: "May they prosper who love you. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Peace be within your walls, Prosperity within your palaces." 

<sup>8</sup> 
For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, "Peace be within you." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good.
