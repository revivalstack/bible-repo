<sup>1</sup> 
Hear my prayer, O Lord, Give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, And in Your righteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Do not enter into judgment with Your servant, For in Your sight no one living is righteous. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has crushed my life to the ground; He has made me dwell in darkness, Like those who have long been dead. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me; My heart within me is distressed. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I spread out my hands to You; My soul longs for You like a thirsty land. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> 
Answer me speedily, O Lord; My spirit fails! Do not hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those who go down into the pit. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning, For in You do I trust; Cause me to know the way in which I should walk, For I lift up my soul to You. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; In You I take shelter. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Teach me to do Your will, For You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Revive me, O Lord, for Your name's sake! For Your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble. 

<sup>12</sup> 
In Your mercy cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am Your servant.
