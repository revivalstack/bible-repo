<sup>1</sup> 
I cry out to the Lord with my voice; With my voice to the Lord I make my supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble. 

<sup>3</sup> 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Look on my right hand and see, For there is no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I cried out to You, O Lord: I said, "You are my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me."
