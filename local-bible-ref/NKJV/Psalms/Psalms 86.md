<sup>1</sup> 
Bow down Your ear, O Lord, hear me; For I am poor and needy. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Preserve my life, for I am holy; You are my God; Save Your servant who trusts in You! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Be merciful to me, O Lord, For I cry to You all day long. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Rejoice the soul of Your servant, For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive, And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; And attend to the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>7</sup> 
In the day of my trouble I will call upon You, For You will answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord; Nor are there any works like Your works. 

<sup>9</sup> 
All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord, And shall glorify Your name. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For You are great, and do wondrous things; You alone are God. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your truth; Unite my heart to fear Your name. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart, And I will glorify Your name forevermore. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For great is Your mercy toward me, And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. 

<sup>14</sup> 
O God, the proud have risen against me, And a mob of violent men have sought my life, And have not set You before them. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious, Longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Oh, turn to me, and have mercy on me! Give Your strength to Your servant, And save the son of Your maidservant. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Show me a sign for good, That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed, Because You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.
