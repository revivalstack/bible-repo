Blessed is he who considers the poor; The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, And he will be blessed on the earth; You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The Lord will strengthen him on his bed of illness; You will sustain him on his sickbed. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I said, "Lord, be merciful to me; Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You." 

<sup>5</sup> 
My enemies speak evil of me: "When will he die, and his name perish?" 

<sup>6</sup> 
And if he comes to see me, he speaks lies; His heart gathers iniquity to itself; When he goes out, he tells it. 

<sup>7</sup> 
All who hate me whisper together against me; Against me they devise my hurt. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"An evil disease," they say, "clings to him. And now that he lies down, he will rise up no more." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted, Who ate my bread, Has lifted up his heel against me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But You, O Lord, be merciful to me, and raise me up, That I may repay them. 

<sup>11</sup> 
By this I know that You are well pleased with me, Because my enemy does not triumph over me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
As for me, You uphold me in my integrity, And set me before Your face forever. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
