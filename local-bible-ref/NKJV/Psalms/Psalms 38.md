<sup>1</sup> 
O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure! 

<sup>2</sup> 
For Your arrows pierce me deeply, And Your hand presses me down. 

<sup>3</sup> 
There is no soundness in my flesh Because of Your anger, Nor any health in my bones Because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For my iniquities have gone over my head; Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
My wounds are foul and festering Because of my foolishness. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For my loins are full of inflammation, And there is no soundness in my flesh. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I am feeble and severely broken; I groan because of the turmoil of my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Lord, all my desire is before You; And my sighing is not hidden from You. 

<sup>10</sup> 
My heart pants, my strength fails me; As for the light of my eyes, it also has gone from me. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague, And my relatives stand afar off. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Those also who seek my life lay snares for me; Those who seek my hurt speak of destruction, And plan deception all the day long. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; And I am like a mute who does not open his mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Thus I am like a man who does not hear, And in whose mouth is no response. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For in You, O Lord, I hope; You will hear, O Lord my God. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For I said, "Hear me, lest they rejoice over me, Lest, when my foot slips, they exalt themselves against me." 

<sup>17</sup> 
For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For I will declare my iniquity; I will be in anguish over my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> 
But my enemies are vigorous, and they are strong; And those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Those also who render evil for good, They are my adversaries, because I follow what is good. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me! 

<sup>22</sup> 
Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
