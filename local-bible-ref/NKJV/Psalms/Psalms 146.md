<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord, O my soul! 

<sup>2</sup> 
While I live I will praise the Lord; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Do not put your trust in princes, Nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help. 

<sup>4</sup> 
His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope is in the Lord his God, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them; Who keeps truth forever, 

<sup>7</sup> 
Who executes justice for the oppressed, Who gives food to the hungry. The Lord gives freedom to the prisoners. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord opens the eyes of the blind; The Lord raises those who are bowed down; The Lord loves the righteous. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The Lord watches over the strangers; He relieves the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked He turns upside down. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The Lord shall reign forever-- Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord!
