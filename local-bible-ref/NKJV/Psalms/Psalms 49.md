Hear this, all peoples; Give ear, all inhabitants of the world, 

<sup>2</sup> 
Both low and high, Rich and poor together. 

<sup>3</sup> 
My mouth shall speak wisdom, And the meditation of my heart shall give understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will disclose my dark saying on the harp. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Why should I fear in the days of evil, When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me? 

<sup>6</sup> 
Those who trust in their wealth And boast in the multitude of their riches, 

<sup>7</sup> 
None of them can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him-- 

<sup>8</sup> 
For the redemption of their souls is costly, And it shall cease forever-- 

<sup>9</sup> 
That he should continue to live eternally, And not see the Pit. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For he sees wise men die; Likewise the fool and the senseless person perish, And leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever, Their dwelling places to all generations; They call their lands after their own names. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Nevertheless man, though in honor, does not remain; He is like the beasts that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> 
This is the way of those who are foolish, And of their posterity who approve their sayings. Selah 

<sup>14</sup> 
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; Death shall feed on them; The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave, far from their dwelling. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave, For He shall receive me. Selah 

<sup>16</sup> 
Do not be afraid when one becomes rich, When the glory of his house is increased; 

<sup>17</sup> 
For when he dies he shall carry nothing away; His glory shall not descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Though while he lives he blesses himself (For men will praise you when you do well for yourself), 

<sup>19</sup> 
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; They shall never see light. 

<sup>20</sup> 
A man who is in honor, yet does not understand, Is like the beasts that perish.
