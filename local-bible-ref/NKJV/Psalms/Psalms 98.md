<sup>1</sup> 
Oh, sing to the Lord a new song! For He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have gained Him the victory. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord has made known His salvation; His righteousness He has revealed in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel; All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Sing to the Lord with the harp, With the harp and the sound of a psalm, 

<sup>6</sup> 
With trumpets and the sound of a horn; Shout joyfully before the Lord, the King. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Let the sea roar, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell in it; 

<sup>8</sup> 
Let the rivers clap their hands; Let the hills be joyful together 

<sup>9</sup> 
before the Lord, For He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, And the peoples with equity.
