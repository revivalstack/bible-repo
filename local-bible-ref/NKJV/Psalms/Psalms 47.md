Oh, clap your hands, all you peoples! Shout to God with the voice of triumph!

For the Lord Most High is awesome; He is a great King over all the earth.

He will subdue the peoples under us, And the nations under our feet. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He will choose our inheritance for us, The excellence of Jacob whom He loves. Selah

God has gone up with a shout, The Lord with the sound of a trumpet.

Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!

For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> 
God reigns over the nations; God sits on His holy throne.

The princes of the people have gathered together, The people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; He is greatly exalted.
