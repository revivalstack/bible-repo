<sup>1</sup> 
My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Why are You so far from helping Me, And from the words of My groaning? 

<sup>2</sup> 
O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear; And in the night season, and am not silent. 

<sup>3</sup> 
But You are holy, Enthroned in the praises of Israel. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Our fathers trusted in You; They trusted, and You delivered them. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They cried to You, and were delivered; They trusted in You, and were not ashamed. 

<sup>6</sup> 
But I am a worm, and no man; A reproach of men, and despised by the people. 

<sup>7</sup> 
All those who see Me ridicule Me; They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 

<sup>8</sup> 
"He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue Him; Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!" 

<sup>9</sup> 
But You are He who took Me out of the womb; You made Me trust while on My mother's breasts. 

<sup>10</sup> 
I was cast upon You from birth. From My mother's womb You have been My God. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Be not far from Me, For trouble is near; For there is none to help. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Many bulls have surrounded Me; Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled Me. 

<sup>13</sup> 
They gape at Me with their mouths, Like a raging and roaring lion. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I am poured out like water, And all My bones are out of joint; My heart is like wax; It has melted within Me. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And My tongue clings to My jaws; You have brought Me to the dust of death. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For dogs have surrounded Me; The congregation of the wicked has enclosed Me. They pierced My hands and My feet; 

<sup>17</sup> 
I can count all My bones. They look and stare at Me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
They divide My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots. 

<sup>19</sup> 
But You, O Lord, do not be far from Me; O My Strength, hasten to help Me! 

<sup>20</sup> 
Deliver Me from the sword, My precious life from the power of the dog. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Save Me from the lion's mouth And from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered Me. 

<sup>22</sup> 
I will declare Your name to My brethren; In the midst of the assembly I will praise You. 

<sup>23</sup> 
You who fear the Lord, praise Him! All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him, And fear Him, all you offspring of Israel! 

<sup>24</sup> 
For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; Nor has He hidden His face from Him; But when He cried to Him, He heard. 

<sup>25</sup> 
My praise shall be of You in the great assembly; I will pay My vows before those who fear Him. 

<sup>26</sup> 
The poor shall eat and be satisfied; Those who seek Him will praise the Lord. Let your heart live forever! 

<sup>27</sup> 
All the ends of the world Shall remember and turn to the Lord, And all the families of the nations Shall worship before You. 

<sup>28</sup> 
For the kingdom is the Lord's, And He rules over the nations. 

<sup>29</sup> 
All the prosperous of the earth Shall eat and worship; All those who go down to the dust Shall bow before Him, Even he who cannot keep himself alive. 

<sup>30</sup> 
A posterity shall serve Him. It will be recounted of the Lord to the next generation, 

<sup>31</sup> 
They will come and declare His righteousness to a people who will be born, That He has done this.
