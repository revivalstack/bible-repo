Lord, remember David And all his afflictions; 

<sup>2</sup> 
How he swore to the Lord, And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 

<sup>3</sup> 
"Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house, Or go up to the comfort of my bed; 

<sup>4</sup> 
I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Until I find a place for the Lord, A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; We found it in the fields of the woods. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Let us go into His tabernacle; Let us worship at His footstool. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, And let Your saints shout for joy. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For Your servant David's sake, Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The Lord has sworn in truth to David; He will not turn from it: "I will set upon your throne the fruit of your body. 

<sup>12</sup> 
If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I shall teach them, Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forevermore." 

<sup>13</sup> 
For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His dwelling place: 

<sup>14</sup> 
"This is My resting place forever; Here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I will also clothe her priests with salvation, And her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 

<sup>17</sup> 
There I will make the horn of David grow; I will prepare a lamp for My Anointed. 

<sup>18</sup> 
His enemies I will clothe with shame, But upon Himself His crown shall flourish."
