<sup>1</sup> 
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord Forever.
