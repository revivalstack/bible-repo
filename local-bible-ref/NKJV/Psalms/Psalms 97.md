<sup>1</sup> 
The Lord reigns; Let the earth rejoice; Let the multitude of isles be glad! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Clouds and darkness surround Him; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. 

<sup>3</sup> 
A fire goes before Him, And burns up His enemies round about. 

<sup>4</sup> 
His lightnings light the world; The earth sees and trembles. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The heavens declare His righteousness, And all the peoples see His glory. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Let all be put to shame who serve carved images, Who boast of idols. Worship Him, all you gods. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Zion hears and is glad, And the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments, O Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For You, Lord, are most high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. 

<sup>10</sup> 
You who love the Lord, hate evil! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Light is sown for the righteous, And gladness for the upright in heart. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.
