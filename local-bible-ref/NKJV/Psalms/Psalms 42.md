<sup>1</sup> 
As the deer pants for the water brooks, So pants my soul for You, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> 
My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? 

<sup>3</sup> 
My tears have been my food day and night, While they continually say to me, "Where is your God?" 

<sup>4</sup> 
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise, With a multitude that kept a pilgrim feast. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance. 

<sup>6</sup> 
O my God, my soul is cast down within me; Therefore I will remember You from the land of the Jordan, And from the heights of Hermon, From the Hill Mizar. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; All Your waves and billows have gone over me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime, And in the night His song shall be with me-- A prayer to the God of my life. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will say to God my Rock, "Why have You forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?" 

<sup>10</sup> 
As with a breaking of my bones, My enemies reproach me, While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" 

<sup>11</sup> 
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
