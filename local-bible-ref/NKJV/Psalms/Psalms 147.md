<sup>1</sup> 
Praise the Lord! For it is good to sing praises to our God; For it is pleasant, and praise is beautiful. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord builds up Jerusalem; He gathers together the outcasts of Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He heals the brokenhearted And binds up their wounds. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding is infinite. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The Lord lifts up the humble; He casts the wicked down to the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; Sing praises on the harp to our God, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to grow on the mountains. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He gives to the beast its food, And to the young ravens that cry. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear Him, In those who hope in His mercy. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion! 

<sup>13</sup> 
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates; He has blessed your children within you. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He makes peace in your borders, And fills you with the finest wheat. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He sends out His command to the earth; His word runs very swiftly. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He gives snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes; 

<sup>17</sup> 
He casts out His hail like morsels; Who can stand before His cold? 

<sup>18</sup> 
He sends out His word and melts them; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His judgments to Israel. 

<sup>20</sup> 
He has not dealt thus with any nation; And as for His judgments, they have not known them. Praise the Lord!
