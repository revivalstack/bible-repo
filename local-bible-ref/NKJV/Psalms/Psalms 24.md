<sup>1</sup> 
The earth is the Lord's, and all its fullness, The world and those who dwell therein. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For He has founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the waters. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who may stand in His holy place? 

<sup>4</sup> 
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol, Nor sworn deceitfully. 

<sup>5</sup> 
He shall receive blessing from the Lord, And righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> 
This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him, Who seek Your face. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> 
Lift up your heads, O you gates! And be lifted up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, The Lord mighty in battle. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Lift up your heads, O you gates! Lift up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah
