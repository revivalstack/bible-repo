<sup>1</sup> 
God is our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Therefore we will not fear, Even though the earth be removed, And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; 

<sup>3</sup> 
Though its waters roar and be troubled, Though the mountains shake with its swelling. Selah 

<sup>4</sup> 
There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High. 

<sup>5</sup> 
God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, just at the break of dawn. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> 
Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has made desolations in the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariot in the fire. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth! 

<sup>11</sup> 
The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah
