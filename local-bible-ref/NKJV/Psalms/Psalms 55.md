<sup>1</sup> 
Give ear to my prayer, O God, And do not hide Yourself from my supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Attend to me, and hear me; I am restless in my complaint, and moan noisily, 

<sup>3</sup> 
Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression of the wicked; For they bring down trouble upon me, And in wrath they hate me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
My heart is severely pained within me, And the terrors of death have fallen upon me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, And horror has overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
So I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Indeed, I would wander far off, And remain in the wilderness. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> 
I would hasten my escape From the windy storm and tempest." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues, For I have seen violence and strife in the city. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Day and night they go around it on its walls; Iniquity and trouble are also in the midst of it. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Destruction is in its midst; Oppression and deceit do not depart from its streets. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For it is not an enemy who reproaches me; Then I could bear it. Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me; Then I could hide from him. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But it was you, a man my equal, My companion and my acquaintance. 

<sup>14</sup> 
We took sweet counsel together, And walked to the house of God in the throng. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Let death seize them; Let them go down alive into hell, For wickedness is in their dwellings and among them. 

<sup>16</sup> 
As for me, I will call upon God, And the Lord shall save me. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry aloud, And He shall hear my voice. 

<sup>18</sup> 
He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, For there were many against me. 

<sup>19</sup> 
God will hear, and afflict them, Even He who abides from of old. Selah Because they do not change, Therefore they do not fear God. 

<sup>20</sup> 
He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; He has broken his covenant. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, But war was in his heart; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Cast your burden on the Lord, And He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved. 

<sup>23</sup> 
But You, O God, shall bring them down to the pit of destruction; Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in You.
