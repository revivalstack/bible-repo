I said, "I will guard my ways, Lest I sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle, While the wicked are before me." 

<sup>2</sup> 
I was mute with silence, I held my peace even from good; And my sorrow was stirred up. 

<sup>3</sup> 
My heart was hot within me; While I was musing, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue: 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Lord, make me to know my end, And what is the measure of my days, That I may know how frail I am. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my age is as nothing before You; Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> 
Surely every man walks about like a shadow; Surely they busy themselves in vain; He heaps up riches, And does not know who will gather them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Deliver me from all my transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I was mute, I did not open my mouth, Because it was You who did it. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Remove Your plague from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand. 

<sup>11</sup> 
When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty melt away like a moth; Surely every man is vapor. Selah 

<sup>12</sup> 
"Hear my prayer, O Lord, And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength, Before I go away and am no more."
