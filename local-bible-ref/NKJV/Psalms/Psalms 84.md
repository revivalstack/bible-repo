How lovely is Your tabernacle, O Lord of hosts! 

<sup>2</sup> 
My soul longs, yes, even faints For the courts of the Lord; My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Even the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she may lay her young-- Even Your altars, O Lord of hosts, My King and my God. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; They will still be praising You. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
Blessed is the man whose strength is in You, Whose heart is set on pilgrimage. 

<sup>6</sup> 
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, They make it a spring; The rain also covers it with pools. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They go from strength to strength; Each one appears before God in Zion. 

<sup>8</sup> 
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah 

<sup>9</sup> 
O God, behold our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For the Lord God is a sun and shield; The Lord will give grace and glory; No good thing will He withhold From those who walk uprightly. 

<sup>12</sup> 
O Lord of hosts, Blessed is the man who trusts in You!
