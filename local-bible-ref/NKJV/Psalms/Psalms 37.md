<sup>1</sup> 
Do not fret because of evildoers, Nor be envious of the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Trust in the Lord, and do good; Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Delight yourself also in the Lord, And He shall give you the desires of your heart. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Commit your way to the Lord, Trust also in Him, And He shall bring it to pass. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, And your justice as the noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; Do not fret--it only causes harm. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For evildoers shall be cut off; But those who wait on the Lord, They shall inherit the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For yet a little while and the wicked shall be no more; Indeed, you will look carefully for his place, But it shall be no more. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But the meek shall inherit the earth, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The wicked plots against the just, And gnashes at him with his teeth. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The Lord laughs at him, For He sees that his day is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The wicked have drawn the sword And have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay those who are of upright conduct. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Their sword shall enter their own heart, And their bows shall be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> 
A little that a righteous man has Is better than the riches of many wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, But the Lord upholds the righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The Lord knows the days of the upright, And their inheritance shall be forever. 

<sup>19</sup> 
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time, And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> 
But the wicked shall perish; And the enemies of the Lord, Like the splendor of the meadows, shall vanish. Into smoke they shall vanish away. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The wicked borrows and does not repay, But the righteous shows mercy and gives. 

<sup>22</sup> 
For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth, But those cursed by Him shall be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, And He delights in his way. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; For the Lord upholds him with His hand. 

<sup>25</sup> 
I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his descendants begging bread. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He is ever merciful, and lends; And his descendants are blessed. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Depart from evil, and do good; And dwell forevermore. 

<sup>28</sup> 
For the Lord loves justice, And does not forsake His saints; They are preserved forever, But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> 
The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell in it forever. 

<sup>30</sup> 
The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom, And his tongue talks of justice. 

<sup>31</sup> 
The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps shall slide. 

<sup>32</sup> 
The wicked watches the righteous, And seeks to slay him. 

<sup>33</sup> 
The Lord will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Wait on the Lord, And keep His way, And He shall exalt you to inherit the land; When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it. 

<sup>35</sup> 
I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a native green tree. 

<sup>36</sup> 
Yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more; Indeed I sought him, but he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> 
Mark the blameless man, and observe the upright; For the future of that man is peace. 

<sup>38</sup> 
But the transgressors shall be destroyed together; The future of the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> 
But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; He is their strength in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> 
And the Lord shall help them and deliver them; He shall deliver them from the wicked, And save them, Because they trust in Him.
