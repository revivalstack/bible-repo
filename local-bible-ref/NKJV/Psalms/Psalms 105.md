<sup>1</sup> 
Oh, give thanks to the Lord! Call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him; Talk of all His wondrous works! 

<sup>3</sup> 
Glory in His holy name; Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the Lord! 

<sup>4</sup> 
Seek the Lord and His strength; Seek His face evermore! 

<sup>5</sup> 
Remember His marvelous works which He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth, 

<sup>6</sup> 
O seed of Abraham His servant, You children of Jacob, His chosen ones! 

<sup>7</sup> 
He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He remembers His covenant forever, The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations, 

<sup>9</sup> 
The covenant which He made with Abraham, And His oath to Isaac, 

<sup>10</sup> 
And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel as an everlasting covenant, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance," 

<sup>12</sup> 
When they were few in number, Indeed very few, and strangers in it. 

<sup>13</sup> 
When they went from one nation to another, From one kingdom to another people, 

<sup>14</sup> 
He permitted no one to do them wrong; Yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes, 

<sup>15</sup> 
Saying, "Do not touch My anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm." 

<sup>16</sup> 
Moreover He called for a famine in the land; He destroyed all the provision of bread. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He sent a man before them-- Joseph--who was sold as a slave. 

<sup>18</sup> 
They hurt his feet with fetters, He was laid in irons. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of the Lord tested him. 

<sup>20</sup> 
The king sent and released him, The ruler of the people let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his possessions, 

<sup>22</sup> 
To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Israel also came into Egypt, And Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He increased His people greatly, And made them stronger than their enemies. 

<sup>25</sup> 
He turned their heart to hate His people, To deal craftily with His servants. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He sent Moses His servant, And Aaron whom He had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> 
They performed His signs among them, And wonders in the land of Ham. 

<sup>28</sup> 
He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they did not rebel against His word. 

<sup>29</sup> 
He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Their land abounded with frogs, Even in the chambers of their kings. 

<sup>31</sup> 
He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their territory. 

<sup>32</sup> 
He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> 
He struck their vines also, and their fig trees, And splintered the trees of their territory. 

<sup>34</sup> 
He spoke, and locusts came, Young locusts without number, 

<sup>35</sup> 
And ate up all the vegetation in their land, And devoured the fruit of their ground. 

<sup>36</sup> 
He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land, The first of all their strength. 

<sup>37</sup> 
He also brought them out with silver and gold, And there was none feeble among His tribes. 

<sup>38</sup> 
Egypt was glad when they departed, For the fear of them had fallen upon them. 

<sup>39</sup> 
He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> 
The people asked, and He brought quail, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

<sup>41</sup> 
He opened the rock, and water gushed out; It ran in the dry places like a river. 

<sup>42</sup> 
For He remembered His holy promise, And Abraham His servant. 

<sup>43</sup> 
He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with gladness. 

<sup>44</sup> 
He gave them the lands of the Gentiles, And they inherited the labor of the nations, 

<sup>45</sup> 
That they might observe His statutes And keep His laws. Praise the Lord!
