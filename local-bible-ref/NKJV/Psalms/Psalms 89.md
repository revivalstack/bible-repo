<sup>1</sup> 
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever; With my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness to all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For I have said, "Mercy shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness You shall establish in the very heavens." 

<sup>3</sup> 
"I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn to My servant David: 

<sup>4</sup> 
'Your seed I will establish forever, And build up your throne to all generations.' " Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
And the heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord; Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord? 

<sup>7</sup> 
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, And to be held in reverence by all those around Him. 

<sup>8</sup> 
O Lord God of hosts, Who is mighty like You, O Lord? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You rule the raging of the sea; When its waves rise, You still them. 

<sup>10</sup> 
You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain; You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; The world and all its fullness, You have founded them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The north and the south, You have created them; Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You have a mighty arm; Strong is Your hand, and high is Your right hand. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; Mercy and truth go before Your face. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound! They walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance. 

<sup>16</sup> 
In Your name they rejoice all day long, And in Your righteousness they are exalted. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For You are the glory of their strength, And in Your favor our horn is exalted. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For our shield belongs to the Lord, And our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one, And said: "I have given help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 

<sup>20</sup> 
I have found My servant David; With My holy oil I have anointed him, 

<sup>21</sup> 
With whom My hand shall be established; Also My arm shall strengthen him. 

<sup>22</sup> 
The enemy shall not outwit him, Nor the son of wickedness afflict him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
I will beat down his foes before his face, And plague those who hate him. 

<sup>24</sup> 
"But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him, And in My name his horn shall be exalted. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Also I will set his hand over the sea, And his right hand over the rivers. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He shall cry to Me, 'You are my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.' 

<sup>27</sup> 
Also I will make him My firstborn, The highest of the kings of the earth. 

<sup>28</sup> 
My mercy I will keep for him forever, And My covenant shall stand firm with him. 

<sup>29</sup> 
His seed also I will make to endure forever, And his throne as the days of heaven. 

<sup>30</sup> 
"If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My judgments, 

<sup>31</sup> 
If they break My statutes And do not keep My commandments, 

<sup>32</sup> 
Then I will punish their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Nevertheless My lovingkindness I will not utterly take from him, Nor allow My faithfulness to fail. 

<sup>34</sup> 
My covenant I will not break, Nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips. 

<sup>35</sup> 
Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David: 

<sup>36</sup> 
His seed shall endure forever, And his throne as the sun before Me; 

<sup>37</sup> 
It shall be established forever like the moon, Even like the faithful witness in the sky." Selah 

<sup>38</sup> 
But You have cast off and abhorred, You have been furious with Your anointed. 

<sup>39</sup> 
You have renounced the covenant of Your servant; You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 

<sup>40</sup> 
You have broken down all his hedges; You have brought his strongholds to ruin. 

<sup>41</sup> 
All who pass by the way plunder him; He is a reproach to his neighbors. 

<sup>42</sup> 
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries; You have made all his enemies rejoice. 

<sup>43</sup> 
You have also turned back the edge of his sword, And have not sustained him in the battle. 

<sup>44</sup> 
You have made his glory cease, And cast his throne down to the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> 
The days of his youth You have shortened; You have covered him with shame. Selah 

<sup>46</sup> 
How long, Lord? Will You hide Yourself forever? Will Your wrath burn like fire? 

<sup>47</sup> 
Remember how short my time is; For what futility have You created all the children of men? 

<sup>48</sup> 
What man can live and not see death? Can he deliver his life from the power of the grave? Selah 

<sup>49</sup> 
Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses, Which You swore to David in Your truth? 

<sup>50</sup> 
Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your servants-- How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many peoples, 

<sup>51</sup> 
With which Your enemies have reproached, O Lord, With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed. 

<sup>52</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord forevermore! Amen and Amen.
