Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised In the city of our God, In His holy mountain. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Beautiful in elevation, The joy of the whole earth, Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, The city of the great King. 

<sup>3</sup> 
God is in her palaces; He is known as her refuge. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For behold, the kings assembled, They passed by together. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They saw it, and so they marveled; They were troubled, they hastened away. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Fear took hold of them there, And pain, as of a woman in birth pangs, 

<sup>7</sup> 
As when You break the ships of Tarshish With an east wind. 

<sup>8</sup> 
As we have heard, So we have seen In the city of the Lord of hosts, In the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah 

<sup>9</sup> 
We have thought, O God, on Your lovingkindness, In the midst of Your temple. 

<sup>10</sup> 
According to Your name, O God, So is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let Mount Zion rejoice, Let the daughters of Judah be glad, Because of Your judgments. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Walk about Zion, And go all around her. Count her towers; 

<sup>13</sup> 
Mark well her bulwarks; Consider her palaces; That you may tell it to the generation following. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For this is God, Our God forever and ever; He will be our guide Even to death.
