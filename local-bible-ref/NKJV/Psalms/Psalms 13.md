<sup>1</sup> 
How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 

<sup>2</sup> 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the sleep of death; 

<sup>4</sup> 
Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him"; Lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 

<sup>5</sup> 
But I have trusted in Your mercy; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I will sing to the Lord, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
