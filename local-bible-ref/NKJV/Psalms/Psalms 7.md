O Lord my God, in You I put my trust; Save me from all those who persecute me; And deliver me, 

<sup>2</sup> 
Lest they tear me like a lion, Rending me in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> 
O Lord my God, if I have done this: If there is iniquity in my hands, 

<sup>4</sup> 
If I have repaid evil to him who was at peace with me, Or have plundered my enemy without cause, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Let the enemy pursue me and overtake me; Yes, let him trample my life to the earth, And lay my honor in the dust. Selah 

<sup>6</sup> 
Arise, O Lord, in Your anger; Lift Yourself up because of the rage of my enemies; Rise up for me to the judgment You have commanded! 

<sup>7</sup> 
So the congregation of the peoples shall surround You; For their sakes, therefore, return on high. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord shall judge the peoples; Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, And according to my integrity within me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, But establish the just; For the righteous God tests the hearts and minds. 

<sup>10</sup> 
My defense is of God, Who saves the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 
God is a just judge, And God is angry with the wicked every day. 

<sup>12</sup> 
If he does not turn back, He will sharpen His sword; He bends His bow and makes it ready. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He also prepares for Himself instruments of death; He makes His arrows into fiery shafts. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Behold, the wicked brings forth iniquity; Yes, he conceives trouble and brings forth falsehood. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He made a pit and dug it out, And has fallen into the ditch which he made. 

<sup>16</sup> 
His trouble shall return upon his own head, And his violent dealing shall come down on his own crown. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.
