"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side," Let Israel now say-- 

<sup>2</sup> 
"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us, 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their wrath was kindled against us; 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our soul; 

<sup>5</sup> 
Then the swollen waters Would have gone over our soul." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us as prey to their teeth. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers; The snare is broken, and we have escaped. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
