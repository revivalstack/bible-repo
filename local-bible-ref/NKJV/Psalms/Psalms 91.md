<sup>1</sup> 
He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will say of the Lord, "He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge; His truth shall be your shield and buckler. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, Nor of the arrow that flies by day, 

<sup>6</sup> 
Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> 
A thousand may fall at your side, And ten thousand at your right hand; But it shall not come near you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Only with your eyes shall you look, And see the reward of the wicked. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, Even the Most High, your dwelling place, 

<sup>10</sup> 
No evil shall befall you, Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; 

<sup>11</sup> 
For He shall give His angels charge over you, To keep you in all your ways. 

<sup>12</sup> 
In their hands they shall bear you up, Lest you dash your foot against a stone. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot. 

<sup>14</sup> 
"Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. 

<sup>16</sup> 
With long life I will satisfy him, And show him My salvation."
