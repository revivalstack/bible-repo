<sup>1</sup> 
Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever You had formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You turn man to destruction, And say, "Return, O children of men." 

<sup>4</sup> 
For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday when it is past, And like a watch in the night. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You carry them away like a flood; They are like a sleep. In the morning they are like grass which grows up: 

<sup>6</sup> 
In the morning it flourishes and grows up; In the evening it is cut down and withers. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For we have been consumed by Your anger, And by Your wrath we are terrified. 

<sup>8</sup> 
You have set our iniquities before You, Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For all our days have passed away in Your wrath; We finish our years like a sigh. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The days of our lives are seventy years; And if by reason of strength they are eighty years, Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Who knows the power of Your anger? For as the fear of You, so is Your wrath. 

<sup>12</sup> 
So teach us to number our days, That we may gain a heart of wisdom. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Return, O Lord! How long? And have compassion on Your servants. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days! 

<sup>15</sup> 
Make us glad according to the days in which You have afflicted us, The years in which we have seen evil. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Let Your work appear to Your servants, And Your glory to their children. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, And establish the work of our hands for us; Yes, establish the work of our hands.
