Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? 

<sup>2</sup> 
The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> 
"Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us." 

<sup>4</sup> 
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The Lord shall hold them in derision. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure: 

<sup>6</sup> 
"Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion." 

<sup>7</sup> 
"I will declare the decree: The Lord has said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.' " 

<sup>10</sup> 
Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Serve the Lord with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish in the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.
