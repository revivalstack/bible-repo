<sup>1</sup> 
O God, why have You cast us off forever? Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture? 

<sup>2</sup> 
Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old, The tribe of Your inheritance, which You have redeemed-- This Mount Zion where You have dwelt. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations. The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place; They set up their banners for signs. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They seem like men who lift up Axes among the thick trees. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And now they break down its carved work, all at once, With axes and hammers. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They have set fire to Your sanctuary; They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They said in their hearts, "Let us destroy them altogether." They have burned up all the meeting places of God in the land. 

<sup>9</sup> 
We do not see our signs; There is no longer any prophet; Nor is there any among us who knows how long. 

<sup>10</sup> 
O God, how long will the adversary reproach? Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever? 

<sup>11</sup> 
Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand? Take it out of Your bosom and destroy them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For God is my King from of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You divided the sea by Your strength; You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters. 

<sup>14</sup> 
You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces, And gave him as food to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 

<sup>15</sup> 
You broke open the fountain and the flood; You dried up mighty rivers. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have prepared the light and the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> 
You have set all the borders of the earth; You have made summer and winter. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Lord, And that a foolish people has blasphemed Your name. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Oh, do not deliver the life of Your turtledove to the wild beast! Do not forget the life of Your poor forever. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Have respect to the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of cruelty. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed! Let the poor and needy praise Your name. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Arise, O God, plead Your own cause; Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Do not forget the voice of Your enemies; The tumult of those who rise up against You increases continually.
