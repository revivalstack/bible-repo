<sup>1</sup> 
To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> 
O my God, I trust in You; Let me not be ashamed; Let not my enemies triumph over me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Indeed, let no one who waits on You be ashamed; Let those be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation; On You I wait all the day. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Remember, O Lord, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses, For they are from of old. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions; According to Your mercy remember me, For Your goodness' sake, O Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Good and upright is the Lord; Therefore He teaches sinners in the way. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The humble He guides in justice, And the humble He teaches His way. 

<sup>10</sup> 
All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For Your name's sake, O Lord, Pardon my iniquity, for it is great. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Who is the man that fears the Lord? Him shall He teach in the way He chooses. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He himself shall dwell in prosperity, And his descendants shall inherit the earth. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him, And He will show them His covenant. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My eyes are ever toward the Lord, For He shall pluck my feet out of the net. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Turn Yourself to me, and have mercy on me, For I am desolate and afflicted. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The troubles of my heart have enlarged; Bring me out of my distresses! 

<sup>18</sup> 
Look on my affliction and my pain, And forgive all my sins. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Consider my enemies, for they are many; And they hate me with cruel hatred. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Keep my soul, and deliver me; Let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in You. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, For I wait for You. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Redeem Israel, O God, Out of all their troubles!
