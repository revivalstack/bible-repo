<sup>1</sup> 
Vindicate me, O God, And plead my cause against an ungodly nation; Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man! 

<sup>2</sup> 
For You are the God of my strength; Why do You cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Oh, send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your tabernacle. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then I will go to the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
