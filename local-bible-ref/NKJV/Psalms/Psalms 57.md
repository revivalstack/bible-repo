<sup>1</sup> 
Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me! For my soul trusts in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, Until these calamities have passed by. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will cry out to God Most High, To God who performs all things for me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He shall send from heaven and save me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up. Selah God shall send forth His mercy and His truth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
My soul is among lions; I lie among the sons of men Who are set on fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah 

<sup>7</sup> 
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Awake, my glory! Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing to You among the nations. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For Your mercy reaches unto the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
