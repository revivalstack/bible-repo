<sup>1</sup> 
The king shall have joy in Your strength, O Lord; And in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 

<sup>2</sup> 
You have given him his heart's desire, And have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah 

<sup>3</sup> 
For You meet him with the blessings of goodness; You set a crown of pure gold upon his head. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He asked life from You, and You gave it to him-- Length of days forever and ever. 

<sup>5</sup> 
His glory is great in Your salvation; Honor and majesty You have placed upon him. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For You have made him most blessed forever; You have made him exceedingly glad with Your presence. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For the king trusts in the Lord, And through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Your hand will find all Your enemies; Your right hand will find those who hate You. 

<sup>9</sup> 
You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger; The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath, And the fire shall devour them. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Their offspring You shall destroy from the earth, And their descendants from among the sons of men. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For they intended evil against You; They devised a plot which they are not able to perform. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Therefore You will make them turn their back; You will make ready Your arrows on Your string toward their faces. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Be exalted, O Lord, in Your own strength! We will sing and praise Your power.
