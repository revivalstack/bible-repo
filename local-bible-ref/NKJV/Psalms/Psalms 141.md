<sup>1</sup> 
Lord, I cry out to You; Make haste to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let my prayer be set before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice wicked works With men who work iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Let the righteous strike me; It shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; It shall be as excellent oil; Let my head not refuse it. For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff, And they hear my words, for they are sweet. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, As when one plows and breaks up the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But my eyes are upon You, O God the Lord; In You I take refuge; Do not leave my soul destitute. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, And from the traps of the workers of iniquity. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I escape safely.
