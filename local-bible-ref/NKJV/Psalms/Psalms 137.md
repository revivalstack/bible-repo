<sup>1</sup> 
By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down, yea, we wept When we remembered Zion. 

<sup>2</sup> 
We hung our harps Upon the willows in the midst of it. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For there those who carried us away captive asked of us a song, And those who plundered us requested mirth, Saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" 

<sup>4</sup> 
How shall we sing the Lord's song In a foreign land? 

<sup>5</sup> 
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, Let my right hand forget its skill! 

<sup>6</sup> 
If I do not remember you, Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth-- If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Remember, O Lord, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it, To its very foundation!" 

<sup>8</sup> 
O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed, Happy the one who repays you as you have served us! 

<sup>9</sup> 
Happy the one who takes and dashes Your little ones against the rock!
