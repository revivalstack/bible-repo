<sup>1</sup> 
In You, O Lord, I put my trust; Let me never be put to shame. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Deliver me in Your righteousness, and cause me to escape; Incline Your ear to me, and save me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Be my strong refuge, To which I may resort continually; You have given the commandment to save me, For You are my rock and my fortress. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For You are my hope, O Lord God; You are my trust from my youth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
By You I have been upheld from birth; You are He who took me out of my mother's womb. My praise shall be continually of You. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I have become as a wonder to many, But You are my strong refuge. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Let my mouth be filled with Your praise And with Your glory all the day. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Do not cast me off in the time of old age; Do not forsake me when my strength fails. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For my enemies speak against me; And those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Saying, "God has forsaken him; Pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him." 

<sup>12</sup> 
O God, do not be far from me; O my God, make haste to help me! 

<sup>13</sup> 
Let them be confounded and consumed Who are adversaries of my life; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor Who seek my hurt. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But I will hope continually, And will praise You yet more and more. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness And Your salvation all the day, For I do not know their limits. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I will go in the strength of the Lord God; I will make mention of Your righteousness, of Yours only. 

<sup>17</sup> 
O God, You have taught me from my youth; And to this day I declare Your wondrous works. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, do not forsake me, Until I declare Your strength to this generation, Your power to everyone who is to come. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Also Your righteousness, O God, is very high, You who have done great things; O God, who is like You? 

<sup>20</sup> 
You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, Shall revive me again, And bring me up again from the depths of the earth. 

<sup>21</sup> 
You shall increase my greatness, And comfort me on every side. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Also with the lute I will praise You-- And Your faithfulness, O my God! To You I will sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> 
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to You, And my soul, which You have redeemed. 

<sup>24</sup> 
My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the day long; For they are confounded, For they are brought to shame Who seek my hurt.
