<sup>1</sup> 
Oh come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the Lord is the great God, And the great King above all gods. 

<sup>4</sup> 
In His hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the hills are His also. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The sea is His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For He is our God, And we are the people of His pasture, And the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice: 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion, As in the day of trial in the wilderness, 

<sup>9</sup> 
When your fathers tested Me; They tried Me, though they saw My work. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For forty years I was grieved with that generation, And said, 'It is a people who go astray in their hearts, And they do not know My ways.' 

<sup>11</sup> 
So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.' "
