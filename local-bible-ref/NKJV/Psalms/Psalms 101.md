<sup>1</sup> 
I will sing of mercy and justice; To You, O Lord, I will sing praises. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will behave wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will You come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I will set nothing wicked before my eyes; I hate the work of those who fall away; It shall not cling to me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know wickedness. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, Him I will destroy; The one who has a haughty look and a proud heart, Him I will not endure. 

<sup>6</sup> 
My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me; He who walks in a perfect way, He shall serve me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house; He who tells lies shall not continue in my presence. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Early I will destroy all the wicked of the land, That I may cut off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.
