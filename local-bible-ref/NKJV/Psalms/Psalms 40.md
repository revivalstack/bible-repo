<sup>1</sup> 
I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, And heard my cry. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, And established my steps. 

<sup>3</sup> 
He has put a new song in my mouth-- Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Many, O Lord my God, are Your wonderful works Which You have done; And Your thoughts toward us Cannot be recounted to You in order; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire; My ears You have opened. Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Then I said, "Behold, I come; In the scroll of the book it is written of me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I delight to do Your will, O my God, And Your law is within my heart." 

<sup>9</sup> 
I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness In the great assembly; Indeed, I do not restrain my lips, O Lord, You Yourself know. 

<sup>10</sup> 
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart; I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation; I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth From the great assembly. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O Lord; Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually preserve me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For innumerable evils have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; Therefore my heart fails me. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me! 

<sup>14</sup> 
Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion Who seek to destroy my life; Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor Who wish me evil. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Let them be confounded because of their shame, Who say to me, "Aha, aha!" 

<sup>16</sup> 
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; Let such as love Your salvation say continually, "The Lord be magnified!" 

<sup>17</sup> 
But I am poor and needy; Yet the Lord thinks upon me. You are my help and my deliverer; Do not delay, O my God.
