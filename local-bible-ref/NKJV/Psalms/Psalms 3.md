Lord, how they have increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Many are they who say of me, "There is no help for him in God." Selah 

<sup>3</sup> 
But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I cried to the Lord with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set themselves against me all around. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Arise, O Lord; Save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Salvation belongs to the Lord. Your blessing is upon Your people. Selah
