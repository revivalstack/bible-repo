<sup>1</sup> 
Give ear to my words, O Lord, Consider my meditation. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Give heed to the voice of my cry, My King and my God, For to You I will pray. 

<sup>3</sup> 
My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy; In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; With favor You will surround him as with a shield.
