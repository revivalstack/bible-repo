<sup>1</sup> 
Truly God is good to Israel, To such as are pure in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> 
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; My steps had nearly slipped. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For I was envious of the boastful, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For there are no pangs in their death, But their strength is firm. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like other men. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Therefore pride serves as their necklace; Violence covers them like a garment. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Their eyes bulge with abundance; They have more than heart could wish. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They scoff and speak wickedly concerning oppression; They speak loftily. 

<sup>9</sup> 
They set their mouth against the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore his people return here, And waters of a full cup are drained by them. 

<sup>11</sup> 
And they say, "How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?" 

<sup>12</sup> 
Behold, these are the ungodly, Who are always at ease; They increase in riches. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain, And washed my hands in innocence. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For all day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning. 

<sup>15</sup> 
If I had said, "I will speak thus," Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children. 

<sup>16</sup> 
When I thought how to understand this, It was too painful for me-- 

<sup>17</sup> 
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; Then I understood their end. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Oh, how they are brought to desolation, as in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. 

<sup>20</sup> 
As a dream when one awakes, So, Lord, when You awake, You shall despise their image. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Thus my heart was grieved, And I was vexed in my mind. 

<sup>22</sup> 
I was so foolish and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Nevertheless I am continually with You; You hold me by my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> 
You will guide me with Your counsel, And afterward receive me to glory. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Whom have I in heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You. 

<sup>26</sup> 
My flesh and my heart fail; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish; You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry. 

<sup>28</sup> 
But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God, That I may declare all Your works.
