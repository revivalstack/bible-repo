The Lord reigns; Let the peoples tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; Let the earth be moved! 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord is great in Zion, And He is high above all the peoples. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let them praise Your great and awesome name-- He is holy.

The King's strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His footstool-- He is holy. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called upon His name; They called upon the Lord, and He answered them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept His testimonies and the ordinance He gave them. 

<sup>8</sup> 
You answered them, O Lord our God; You were to them God-Who-Forgives, Though You took vengeance on their deeds. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His holy hill; For the Lord our God is holy.
