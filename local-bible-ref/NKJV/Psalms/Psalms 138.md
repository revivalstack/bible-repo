I will praise You with my whole heart; Before the gods I will sing praises to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name. 

<sup>3</sup> 
In the day when I cried out, You answered me, And made me bold with strength in my soul. 

<sup>4</sup> 
All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O Lord, When they hear the words of Your mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the Lord, For great is the glory of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Though the Lord is on high, Yet He regards the lowly; But the proud He knows from afar. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand will save me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy, O Lord, endures forever; Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
