<sup>1</sup> 
O Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before You. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let my prayer come before You; Incline Your ear to my cry. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draws near to the grave. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I am counted with those who go down to the pit; I am like a man who has no strength, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Adrift among the dead, Like the slain who lie in the grave, Whom You remember no more, And who are cut off from Your hand. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You have laid me in the lowest pit, In darkness, in the depths. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Your wrath lies heavy upon me, And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah 

<sup>8</sup> 
You have put away my acquaintances far from me; You have made me an abomination to them; I am shut up, and I cannot get out; 

<sup>9</sup> 
My eye wastes away because of affliction. Lord, I have called daily upon You; I have stretched out my hands to You. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Will You work wonders for the dead? Shall the dead arise and praise You? Selah 

<sup>11</sup> 
Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave? Or Your faithfulness in the place of destruction? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Shall Your wonders be known in the dark? And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

<sup>13</sup> 
But to You I have cried out, O Lord, And in the morning my prayer comes before You. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Lord, why do You cast off my soul? Why do You hide Your face from me? 

<sup>15</sup> 
I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth; I suffer Your terrors; I am distraught. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Your fierce wrath has gone over me; Your terrors have cut me off. 

<sup>17</sup> 
They came around me all day long like water; They engulfed me altogether. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Loved one and friend You have put far from me, And my acquaintances into darkness.
