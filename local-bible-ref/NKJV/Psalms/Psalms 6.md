<sup>1</sup> 
O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 

<sup>3</sup> 
My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O Lord--how long? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Return, O Lord, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake! 

<sup>5</sup> 
For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> 
I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears. 

<sup>7</sup> 
My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The Lord has heard my supplication; The Lord will receive my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.
