<sup>1</sup> 
The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, They have done abominable works, There is none who does good. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there are any who understand, who seek God. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They have all turned aside, They have together become corrupt; There is none who does good, No, not one. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people as they eat bread, And do not call on the Lord? 

<sup>5</sup> 
There they are in great fear, For God is with the generation of the righteous. 

<sup>6</sup> 
You shame the counsel of the poor, But the Lord is his refuge. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord brings back the captivity of His people, Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.
