Truly my soul silently waits for God; From Him comes my salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved.

They only consult to cast him down from his high position; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, But they curse inwardly. Selah 

<sup>5</sup> 
My soul, wait silently for God alone, For my expectation is from Him. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be moved. 

<sup>7</sup> 
In God is my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength, And my refuge, is in God. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Trust in Him at all times, you people; Pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah

Surely men of low degree are a vapor, Men of high degree are a lie; If they are weighed on the scales, They are altogether lighter than vapor. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Do not trust in oppression, Nor vainly hope in robbery; If riches increase, Do not set your heart on them. 

<sup>11</sup> 
God has spoken once, Twice I have heard this: That power belongs to God. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Also to You, O Lord, belongs mercy; For You render to each one according to his work.
