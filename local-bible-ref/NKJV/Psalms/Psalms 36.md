<sup>1</sup> 
An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked: There is no fear of God before his eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For he flatters himself in his own eyes, When he finds out his iniquity and when he hates. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise and to do good. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He devises wickedness on his bed; He sets himself in a way that is not good; He does not abhor evil. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Your righteousness is like the great mountains; Your judgments are a great deep; O Lord, You preserve man and beast. 

<sup>7</sup> 
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. 

<sup>8</sup> 
They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house, And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Oh, continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let not the foot of pride come against me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

<sup>12</sup> 
There the workers of iniquity have fallen; They have been cast down and are not able to rise.
