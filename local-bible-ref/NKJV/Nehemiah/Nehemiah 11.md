Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, and nine-tenths were to dwell in other cities. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup> 
These are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their cities--Israelites, priests, Levites, Nethinim, and descendants of Solomon's servants.) 

<sup>4</sup> 
Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin. The children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez;

<sup>11</sup> 
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the leader of the house of God.

<sup>14</sup>

<sup>15</sup> 
Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; 

<sup>16</sup>

<sup>18</sup> 
All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Moreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren who kept the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And the rest of Israel, of the priests and Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. 

<sup>21</sup> 
But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Also the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers in charge of the service of the house of God. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For it was the king's command concerning them that a certain portion should be for the singers, a quota day by day. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king's deputy in all matters concerning the people.

<sup>25</sup> 
And as for the villages with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, Jekabzeel and its villages;

<sup>36</sup> 
Some of the Judean divisions of Levites were in Benjamin.
