"At that time Michael shall stand up, The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, Such as never was since there was a nation, Even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, Every one who is found written in the book.

"And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away, and the abomination of desolation is set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.

"But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days."
