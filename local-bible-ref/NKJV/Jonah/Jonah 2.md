Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish's belly. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And he said: "I cried out to the Lord because of my affliction, And He answered me. "Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For You cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, And the floods surrounded me; All Your billows and Your waves passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then I said, 'I have been cast out of Your sight; Yet I will look again toward Your holy temple.' 

<sup>5</sup> 
The waters surrounded me, even to my soul; The deep closed around me; Weeds were wrapped around my head. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I went down to the moorings of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed behind me forever; Yet You have brought up my life from the pit, O Lord, my God. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord; And my prayer went up to You, Into Your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Those who regard worthless idols Forsake their own Mercy. 

<sup>9</sup> 
But I will sacrifice to You With the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay what I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord." 

<sup>10</sup> 
So the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
