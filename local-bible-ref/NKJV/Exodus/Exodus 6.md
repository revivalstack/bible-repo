Then the Lord said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For with a strong hand he will let them go, and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land." 

<sup>2</sup> 
And God spoke to Moses and said to him: "I am the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Lord I was not known to them. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I have also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered My covenant. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Therefore say to the children of Israel: 'I am the Lord; I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, I will rescue you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I will take you as My people, and I will be your God. Then you shall know that I am the Lord your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as a heritage: I am the Lord.' "

<sup>11</sup> 
"Go in, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land." 

<sup>12</sup> 
And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, "The children of Israel have not heeded me. How then shall Pharaoh heed me, for I am of uncircumcised lips?" 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command for the children of Israel and for Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

that the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, "I am the Lord. Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say to you." 

<sup>30</sup> 
But Moses said before the Lord, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh heed me?"
