"You shall make an altar of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide--the altar shall be square--and its height shall be three cubits. 

<sup>2</sup> 
You shall make its horns on its four corners; its horns shall be of one piece with it. And you shall overlay it with bronze. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Also you shall make its pans to receive its ashes, and its shovels and its basins and its forks and its firepans; you shall make all its utensils of bronze. 

<sup>4</sup> 
You shall make a grate for it, a network of bronze; and on the network you shall make four bronze rings at its four corners. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You shall put it under the rim of the altar beneath, that the network may be midway up the altar. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with bronze. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The poles shall be put in the rings, and the poles shall be on the two sides of the altar to bear it. 

<sup>8</sup> 
You shall make it hollow with boards; as it was shown you on the mountain, so shall they make it.

<sup>10</sup> 
And its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets shall be bronze. The hooks of the pillars and their bands shall be silver. 

<sup>11</sup>

<sup>13</sup> 
The width of the court on the east side shall be fifty cubits. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The hangings on one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And on the other side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits, with their three pillars and their three sockets. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"For the gate of the court there shall be a screen twenty cubits long, woven of blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine woven linen, made by a weaver. It shall have four pillars and four sockets. 

<sup>17</sup> 
All the pillars around the court shall have bands of silver; their hooks shall be of silver and their sockets of bronze. 

<sup>18</sup> 
The length of the court shall be one hundred cubits, the width fifty throughout, and the height five cubits, made of fine woven linen, and its sockets of bronze. 

<sup>19</sup> 
All the utensils of the tabernacle for all its service, all its pegs, and all the pegs of the court, shall be of bronze.

<sup>20</sup> 
"And you shall command the children of Israel that they bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to cause the lamp to burn continually. 

<sup>21</sup> 
In the tabernacle of meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall tend it from evening until morning before the Lord. It shall be a statute forever to their generations on behalf of the children of Israel.
