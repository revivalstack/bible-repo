Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"You only have I known of all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Can two walk together, unless they are agreed? 

<sup>4</sup> 
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den, if he has caught nothing? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth, where there is no trap for it? Will a snare spring up from the earth, if it has caught nothing at all? 

<sup>6</sup> 
If a trumpet is blown in a city, will not the people be afraid? If there is calamity in a city, will not the Lord have done it? 

<sup>7</sup> 
Surely the Lord God does nothing, Unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets. 

<sup>8</sup> 
A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken! Who can but prophesy? 

<sup>9</sup> 
"Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod, And in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say: 'Assemble on the mountains of Samaria; See great tumults in her midst, And the oppressed within her. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For they do not know to do right,' Says the Lord, 'Who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.' " 

<sup>11</sup> 
Therefore thus says the Lord God: "An adversary shall be all around the land; He shall sap your strength from you, And your palaces shall be plundered." 

<sup>12</sup> 
Thus says the Lord: "As a shepherd takes from the mouth of a lion Two legs or a piece of an ear, So shall the children of Israel be taken out Who dwell in Samaria-- In the corner of a bed and on the edge of a couch! 

<sup>13</sup> 
Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Says the Lord God, the God of hosts, 

<sup>14</sup> 
"That in the day I punish Israel for their transgressions, I will also visit destruction on the altars of Bethel; And the horns of the altar shall be cut off And fall to the ground. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I will destroy the winter house along with the summer house; The houses of ivory shall perish, And the great houses shall have an end," Says the Lord.
