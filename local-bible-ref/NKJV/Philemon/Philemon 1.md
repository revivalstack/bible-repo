<sup>1</sup> 
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer, 

<sup>2</sup> 
to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: 

<sup>3</sup> 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>4</sup> 
I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, 

<sup>5</sup> 
hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, 

<sup>6</sup> 
that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.

<sup>8</sup> 
Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, 

<sup>9</sup> 
yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you--being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ-- 

<sup>10</sup> 
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains, 

<sup>11</sup> 
who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, 

<sup>13</sup> 
whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever, 

<sup>16</sup> 
no longer as a slave but more than a slave--a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

<sup>17</sup> 
If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. 

<sup>19</sup> 
I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay--not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.

<sup>23</sup> 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 

<sup>24</sup> 
as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers. 

<sup>25</sup> 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
