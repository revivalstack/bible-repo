<sup>1</sup> 
But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: 

<sup>2</sup> 
that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; 

<sup>3</sup> 
the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things-- 

<sup>4</sup> 
that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 

<sup>5</sup> 
to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 

<sup>7</sup> 
in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, 

<sup>8</sup> 
sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, 

<sup>10</sup> 
not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.

<sup>11</sup> 
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, 

<sup>12</sup> 
teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 

<sup>13</sup> 
looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 

<sup>14</sup> 
who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.
