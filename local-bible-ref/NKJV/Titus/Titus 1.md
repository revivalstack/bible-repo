Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, 

<sup>2</sup> 
in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, 

<sup>3</sup> 
but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;

One of them, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."

This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 

<sup>14</sup> 
not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth. 

<sup>15</sup>

<sup>16</sup> 
They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.
