<sup>1</sup> 
But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me? 

<sup>3</sup> 
And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you. 

<sup>5</sup> 
But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent--not to be too severe. 

<sup>6</sup> 
This punishment which was inflicted by the majority is sufficient for such a man, 

<sup>7</sup> 
so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, 

<sup>11</sup> 
lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.

<sup>12</sup> 
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, 

<sup>13</sup> 
I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 

<sup>16</sup> 
To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things? 

<sup>17</sup> 
For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.
