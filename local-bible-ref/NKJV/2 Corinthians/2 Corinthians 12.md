<sup>1</sup> 
It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: 

<sup>2</sup> 
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows--such a one was caught up to the third heaven. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And I know such a man--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows-- 

<sup>4</sup> 
how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me.

<sup>7</sup> 
And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness." Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

<sup>11</sup> 
I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong! 

<sup>14</sup> 
Now for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved. 

<sup>16</sup> 
But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning! 

<sup>17</sup> 
Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? 

<sup>18</sup> 
I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps? 

<sup>19</sup> 
Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification. 

<sup>20</sup> 
For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults; 

<sup>21</sup> 
lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced.
