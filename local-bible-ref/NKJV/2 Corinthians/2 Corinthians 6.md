We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, And in the day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation. 

<sup>3</sup> 
We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, 

<sup>5</sup> 
in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; 

<sup>6</sup> 
by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 

<sup>7</sup> 
by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 

<sup>8</sup> 
by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 

<sup>9</sup> 
as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not killed; 

<sup>10</sup> 
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.

<sup>11</sup> 
O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open. 

<sup>12</sup> 
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? 

<sup>15</sup> 
And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? 

<sup>16</sup> 
And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people." 

<sup>17</sup> 
Therefore "Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, And I will receive you." 

<sup>18</sup> 
"I will be a Father to you, And you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty."
