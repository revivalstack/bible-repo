<sup>1</sup> 
I have come to my garden, my sister, my spouse; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends! Drink, yes, drink deeply, O beloved ones! 

<sup>2</sup> 
I sleep, but my heart is awake; It is the voice of my beloved! He knocks, saying, "Open for me, my sister, my love, My dove, my perfect one; For my head is covered with dew, My locks with the drops of the night." 

<sup>3</sup> 
I have taken off my robe; How can I put it on again? I have washed my feet; How can I defile them? 

<sup>4</sup> 
My beloved put his hand By the latch of the door, And my heart yearned for him. 

<sup>5</sup> 
I arose to open for my beloved, And my hands dripped with myrrh, My fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the lock. 

<sup>6</sup> 
I opened for my beloved, But my beloved had turned away and was gone. My heart leaped up when he spoke. I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The watchmen who went about the city found me. They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls Took my veil away from me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, That you tell him I am lovesick! 

<sup>9</sup> 
What is your beloved More than another beloved, O fairest among women? What is your beloved More than another beloved, That you so charge us? 

<sup>10</sup> 
My beloved is white and ruddy, Chief among ten thousand. 

<sup>11</sup> 
His head is like the finest gold; His locks are wavy, And black as a raven. 

<sup>12</sup> 
His eyes are like doves By the rivers of waters, Washed with milk, And fitly set. 

<sup>13</sup> 
His cheeks are like a bed of spices, Banks of scented herbs. His lips are lilies, Dripping liquid myrrh. 

<sup>14</sup> 
His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl. His body is carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires. 

<sup>15</sup> 
His legs are pillars of marble Set on bases of fine gold. His countenance is like Lebanon, Excellent as the cedars. 

<sup>16</sup> 
His mouth is most sweet, Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, And this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem!
