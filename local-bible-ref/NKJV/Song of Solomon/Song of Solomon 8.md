Oh, that you were like my brother, Who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I should find you outside, I would kiss you; I would not be despised. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I would lead you and bring you Into the house of my mother, She who used to instruct me. I would cause you to drink of spiced wine, Of the juice of my pomegranate. 

<sup>3</sup> 
His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases.

<sup>5</sup> 
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Leaning upon her beloved? I awakened you under the apple tree. There your mother brought you forth; There she who bore you brought you forth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Set me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jealousy as cruel as the grave; Its flames are flames of fire, A most vehement flame. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Many waters cannot quench love, Nor can the floods drown it. If a man would give for love All the wealth of his house, It would be utterly despised. 

<sup>8</sup> 
We have a little sister, And she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister In the day when she is spoken for? 

<sup>9</sup> 
If she is a wall, We will build upon her A battlement of silver; And if she is a door, We will enclose her With boards of cedar. 

<sup>10</sup> 
I am a wall, And my breasts like towers; Then I became in his eyes As one who found peace. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon; He leased the vineyard to keepers; Everyone was to bring for its fruit A thousand silver coins. 

<sup>12</sup> 
My own vineyard is before me. You, O Solomon, may have a thousand, And those who tend its fruit two hundred. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You who dwell in the gardens, The companions listen for your voice-- Let me hear it! 

<sup>14</sup> 
Make haste, my beloved, And be like a gazelle Or a young stag On the mountains of spices.
