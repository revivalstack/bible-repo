"I will rise now," I said, "And go about the city; In the streets and in the squares I will seek the one I love." I sought him, but I did not find him. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The watchmen who go about the city found me; I said, "Have you seen the one I love?"

Of the wood of Lebanon Solomon the King Made himself a palanquin:

He made its pillars of silver, Its support of gold, Its seat of purple, Its interior paved with love By the daughters of Jerusalem. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Go forth, O daughters of Zion, And see King Solomon with the crown With which his mother crowned him On the day of his wedding, The day of the gladness of his heart.
