<sup>1</sup> 
I am the rose of Sharon, And the lily of the valleys. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Like a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Like an apple tree among the trees of the woods, So is my beloved among the sons. I sat down in his shade with great delight, And his fruit was sweet to my taste. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He brought me to the banqueting house, And his banner over me was love. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Sustain me with cakes of raisins, Refresh me with apples, For I am lovesick. 

<sup>6</sup> 
His left hand is under my head, And his right hand embraces me. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the does of the field, Do not stir up nor awaken love Until it pleases.

<sup>8</sup> 
The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills. 

<sup>9</sup> 
My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he stands behind our wall; He is looking through the windows, Gazing through the lattice. 

<sup>10</sup> 
My beloved spoke, and said to me: "Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing has come, And the voice of the turtledove Is heard in our land. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The fig tree puts forth her green figs, And the vines with the tender grapes Give a good smell. Rise up, my love, my fair one, And come away! 

<sup>14</sup> 
"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret places of the cliff, Let me see your face, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your face is lovely." 

<sup>15</sup> 
Catch us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vines, For our vines have tender grapes. 

<sup>16</sup> 
My beloved is mine, and I am his. He feeds his flock among the lilies. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Until the day breaks And the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, And be like a gazelle Or a young stag Upon the mountains of Bether.
