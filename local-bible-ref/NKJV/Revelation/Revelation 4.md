After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this." 

<sup>2</sup> 
Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!" 

<sup>9</sup> 
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, 

<sup>10</sup> 
the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying: 

<sup>11</sup> 
"You are worthy, O Lord, To receive glory and honor and power; For You created all things, And by Your will they exist and were created."
