Moreover David and the captains of the army separated for the service some of the sons of Asaph, of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, stringed instruments, and cymbals. And the number of the skilled men performing their service was: 

<sup>2</sup> 
Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah; the sons of Asaph were under the direction of Asaph, who prophesied according to the order of the king. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and to praise the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Of Heman, the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. 

<sup>5</sup> 
All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to exalt his horn. For God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 

<sup>6</sup> 
All these were under the direction of their father for the music in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under the authority of the king. 

<sup>7</sup> 
So the number of them, with their brethren who were instructed in the songs of the Lord, all who were skillful, was two hundred and eighty-eight. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And they cast lots for their duty, the small as well as the great, the teacher with the student. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Now the first lot for Asaph came out for Joseph; the second for Gedaliah, him with his brethren and sons, twelve; 

<sup>10</sup>

<sup>15</sup> 
the eighth for Jeshaiah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; 

<sup>16</sup> 
the ninth for Mattaniah, his sons and his brethren, twelve; 

<sup>17</sup> 
the tenth for Shimei, his sons and his brethren, twelve;
