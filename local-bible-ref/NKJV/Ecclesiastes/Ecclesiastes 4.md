<sup>1</sup> 
Then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the sun: And look! The tears of the oppressed, But they have no comforter-- On the side of their oppressors there is power, But they have no comforter. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead, More than the living who are still alive. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Yet, better than both is he who has never existed, Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

<sup>4</sup> 
Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The fool folds his hands And consumes his own flesh. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Better a handful with quietness Than both hands full, together with toil and grasping for the wind. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun: 

<sup>8</sup> 
There is one alone, without companion: He has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his labors, Nor is his eye satisfied with riches. But he never asks, "For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?" This also is vanity and a grave misfortune.

<sup>9</sup> 
Two are better than one, Because they have a good reward for their labor. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For if they fall, one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls, For he has no one to help him up. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; But how can one be warm alone? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

<sup>13</sup> 
Better a poor and wise youth Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For he comes out of prison to be king, Although he was born poor in his kingdom. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I saw all the living who walk under the sun; They were with the second youth who stands in his place. 

<sup>16</sup> 
There was no end of all the people over whom he was made king; Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind.
