There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 

<sup>2</sup> 
A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This is vanity, and it is an evil affliction. 

<sup>3</sup> 
If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he-- 

<sup>4</sup> 
for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, this has more rest than that man, 

<sup>6</sup> 
even if he lives a thousand years twice--but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place? 

<sup>7</sup> 
All the labor of man is for his mouth, And yet the soul is not satisfied. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For what more has the wise man than the fool? What does the poor man have, Who knows how to walk before the living? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Whatever one is, he has been named already, For it is known that he is man; And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Since there are many things that increase vanity, How is man the better? 

<sup>12</sup> 
For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?
