Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth, Before the difficult days come, And the years draw near when you say, "I have no pleasure in them": 

<sup>2</sup> 
While the sun and the light, The moon and the stars, Are not darkened, And the clouds do not return after the rain; 

<sup>3</sup> 
In the day when the keepers of the house tremble, And the strong men bow down; When the grinders cease because they are few, And those that look through the windows grow dim; 

<sup>4</sup> 
When the doors are shut in the streets, And the sound of grinding is low; When one rises up at the sound of a bird, And all the daughters of music are brought low. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Also they are afraid of height, And of terrors in the way; When the almond tree blossoms, The grasshopper is a burden, And desire fails. For man goes to his eternal home, And the mourners go about the streets. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Remember your Creator before the silver cord is loosed, Or the golden bowl is broken, Or the pitcher shattered at the fountain, Or the wheel broken at the well. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it.

"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher, "All is vanity." 

<sup>9</sup> 
And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he pondered and sought out and set in order many proverbs. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and what was written was upright--words of truth. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars are like well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And further, my son, be admonished by these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is wearisome to the flesh. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, For this is man's all. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For God will bring every work into judgment, Including every secret thing, Whether good or evil.
