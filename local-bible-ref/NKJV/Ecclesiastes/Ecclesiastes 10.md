Dead flies putrefy the perfumer's ointment, And cause it to give off a foul odor; So does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor. 

<sup>2</sup> 
A wise man's heart is at his right hand, But a fool's heart at his left. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Even when a fool walks along the way, He lacks wisdom, And he shows everyone that he is a fool. 

<sup>4</sup> 
If the spirit of the ruler rises against you, Do not leave your post; For conciliation pacifies great offenses. 

<sup>5</sup> 
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, As an error proceeding from the ruler: 

<sup>6</sup> 
Folly is set in great dignity, While the rich sit in a lowly place. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I have seen servants on horses, While princes walk on the ground like servants. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He who digs a pit will fall into it, And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He who quarries stones may be hurt by them, And he who splits wood may be endangered by it. 

<sup>10</sup> 
If the ax is dull, And one does not sharpen the edge, Then he must use more strength; But wisdom brings success. 

<sup>11</sup> 
A serpent may bite when it is not charmed; The babbler is no different. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious, But the lips of a fool shall swallow him up; 

<sup>13</sup> 
The words of his mouth begin with foolishness, And the end of his talk is raving madness. 

<sup>14</sup> 
A fool also multiplies words. No man knows what is to be; Who can tell him what will be after him? 

<sup>15</sup> 
The labor of fools wearies them, For they do not even know how to go to the city! 

<sup>16</sup> 
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, And your princes feast in the morning! 

<sup>17</sup> 
Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, And your princes feast at the proper time-- For strength and not for drunkenness! 

<sup>18</sup> 
Because of laziness the building decays, And through idleness of hands the house leaks. 

<sup>19</sup> 
A feast is made for laughter, And wine makes merry; But money answers everything. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Do not curse the king, even in your thought; Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom; For a bird of the air may carry your voice, And a bird in flight may tell the matter.
