The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." 

<sup>3</sup> 
What profit has a man from all his labor In which he toils under the sun? 

<sup>4</sup> 
One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit. 

<sup>7</sup> 
All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; To the place from which the rivers come, There they return again. 

<sup>8</sup> 
All things are full of labor; Man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing. 

<sup>9</sup> 
That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Is there anything of which it may be said, "See, this is new"? It has already been in ancient times before us. 

<sup>11</sup> 
There is no remembrance of former things, Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after.

<sup>12</sup> 
I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind. 

<sup>15</sup> 
What is crooked cannot be made straight, And what is lacking cannot be numbered. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I communed with my heart, saying, "Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge." 

<sup>17</sup> 
And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For in much wisdom is much grief, And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
