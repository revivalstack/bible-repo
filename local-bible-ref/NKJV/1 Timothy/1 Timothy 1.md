Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope, 

<sup>2</sup> 
To Timothy, a true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

<sup>3</sup> 
As I urged you when I went into Macedonia--remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 

<sup>4</sup> 
nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith, 

<sup>6</sup> 
from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, 

<sup>7</sup> 
desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, 

<sup>9</sup> 
knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 

<sup>10</sup> 
for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 

<sup>11</sup> 
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.

<sup>12</sup> 
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, 

<sup>13</sup> 
although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 

<sup>14</sup> 
And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>15</sup> 
This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. 

<sup>16</sup> 
However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

<sup>18</sup> 
This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, 

<sup>19</sup> 
having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, 

<sup>20</sup> 
of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.
