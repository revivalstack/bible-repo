<sup>1</sup> 
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, 

<sup>2</sup> 
for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 

<sup>4</sup> 
who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> 
who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, 

<sup>7</sup> 
for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle--I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying--a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

<sup>8</sup> 
I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting; 

<sup>9</sup> 
in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, 

<sup>10</sup> 
but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 

<sup>14</sup> 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
