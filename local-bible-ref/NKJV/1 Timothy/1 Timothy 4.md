Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 

<sup>2</sup> 
speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, 

<sup>3</sup> 
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; 

<sup>5</sup> 
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

<sup>6</sup> 
If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed.

<sup>8</sup>

<sup>12</sup>

<sup>14</sup> 
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
