Woe to those who devise iniquity, And work out evil on their beds! At morning light they practice it, Because it is in the power of their hand. 

<sup>2</sup> 
They covet fields and take them by violence, Also houses, and seize them. So they oppress a man and his house, A man and his inheritance. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Therefore thus says the Lord: "Behold, against this family I am devising disaster, From which you cannot remove your necks; Nor shall you walk haughtily, For this is an evil time. 

<sup>4</sup> 
In that day one shall take up a proverb against you, And lament with a bitter lamentation, saying: 'We are utterly destroyed! He has changed the heritage of my people; How He has removed it from me! To a turncoat He has divided our fields.' " 

<sup>5</sup> 
Therefore you will have no one to determine boundaries by lot In the assembly of the Lord.

<sup>6</sup> 
"Do not prattle," you say to those who prophesy. So they shall not prophesy to you; They shall not return insult for insult. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You who are named the house of Jacob: "Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted? Are these His doings? Do not My words do good To him who walks uprightly? 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Lately My people have risen up as an enemy-- You pull off the robe with the garment From those who trust you, as they pass by, Like men returned from war. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The women of My people you cast out From their pleasant houses; From their children You have taken away My glory forever. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"Arise and depart, For this is not your rest; Because it is defiled, it shall destroy, Yes, with utter destruction. 

<sup>11</sup> 
If a man should walk in a false spirit And speak a lie, saying, 'I will prophesy to you of wine and drink,' Even he would be the prattler of this people.

<sup>12</sup> 
"I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together like sheep of the fold, Like a flock in the midst of their pasture; They shall make a loud noise because of so many people. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The one who breaks open will come up before them; They will break out, Pass through the gate, And go out by it; Their king will pass before them, With the Lord at their head."
