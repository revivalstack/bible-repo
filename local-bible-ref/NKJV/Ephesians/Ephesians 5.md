<sup>1</sup> 
Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma. 

<sup>3</sup> 
But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; 

<sup>4</sup> 
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore do not be partakers with them.

<sup>8</sup> 
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 

<sup>9</sup> 
(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 

<sup>10</sup> 
finding out what is acceptable to the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> 
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Therefore He says: "Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light." 

<sup>15</sup> 
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, 

<sup>16</sup> 
redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 

<sup>18</sup> 
And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, 

<sup>19</sup> 
speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, 

<sup>20</sup> 
giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>21</sup> 
submitting to one another in the fear of God.

<sup>22</sup> 
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 

<sup>26</sup> 
that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 

<sup>27</sup> 
that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. 

<sup>28</sup> 
So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. 

<sup>29</sup> 
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church. 

<sup>30</sup> 
For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. 

<sup>31</sup> 
"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." 

<sup>32</sup> 
This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
