Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus: 

<sup>2</sup> 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>3</sup> 
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> 
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 

<sup>5</sup> 
having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 

<sup>6</sup> 
to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved. 

<sup>7</sup> 
In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 

<sup>8</sup> 
which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 

<sup>9</sup> 
having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 

<sup>10</sup> 
that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth--in Him. 

<sup>11</sup> 
In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 

<sup>12</sup> 
that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. 

<sup>13</sup> 
In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 

<sup>14</sup> 
who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.

<sup>15</sup> 
Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 

<sup>16</sup> 
do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: 

<sup>17</sup> 
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 

<sup>18</sup> 
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 

<sup>19</sup> 
and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 

<sup>20</sup> 
which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, 

<sup>21</sup> 
far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, 

<sup>23</sup> 
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
