<sup>1</sup> 
Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you, O house of Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Thus says the Lord: "Do not learn the way of the Gentiles; Do not be dismayed at the signs of heaven, For the Gentiles are dismayed at them. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the customs of the peoples are futile; For one cuts a tree from the forest, The work of the hands of the workman, with the ax. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They decorate it with silver and gold; They fasten it with nails and hammers So that it will not topple. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They are upright, like a palm tree, And they cannot speak; They must be carried, Because they cannot go by themselves. Do not be afraid of them, For they cannot do evil, Nor can they do any good." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Inasmuch as there is none like You, O Lord (You are great, and Your name is great in might), 

<sup>7</sup> 
Who would not fear You, O King of the nations? For this is Your rightful due. For among all the wise men of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, There is none like You. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But they are altogether dull-hearted and foolish; A wooden idol is a worthless doctrine. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Silver is beaten into plates; It is brought from Tarshish, And gold from Uphaz, The work of the craftsman And of the hands of the metalsmith; Blue and purple are their clothing; They are all the work of skillful men. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But the Lord is the true God; He is the living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will tremble, And the nations will not be able to endure His indignation. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Thus you shall say to them: "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens." 

<sup>12</sup> 
He has made the earth by His power, He has established the world by His wisdom, And has stretched out the heavens at His discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> 
When He utters His voice, There is a multitude of waters in the heavens: "And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain, He brings the wind out of His treasuries." 

<sup>14</sup> 
Everyone is dull-hearted, without knowledge; Every metalsmith is put to shame by an image; For his molded image is falsehood, And there is no breath in them. 

<sup>15</sup> 
They are futile, a work of errors; In the time of their punishment they shall perish. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The Portion of Jacob is not like them, For He is the Maker of all things, And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance; The Lord of hosts is His name.

<sup>17</sup> 
Gather up your wares from the land, O inhabitant of the fortress! 

<sup>18</sup> 
For thus says the Lord: "Behold, I will throw out at this time The inhabitants of the land, And will distress them, That they may find it so." 

<sup>19</sup> 
Woe is me for my hurt! My wound is severe. But I say, "Truly this is an infirmity, And I must bear it." 

<sup>20</sup> 
My tent is plundered, And all my cords are broken; My children have gone from me, And they are no more. There is no one to pitch my tent anymore, Or set up my curtains. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For the shepherds have become dull-hearted, And have not sought the Lord; Therefore they shall not prosper, And all their flocks shall be scattered. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Behold, the noise of the report has come, And a great commotion out of the north country, To make the cities of Judah desolate, a den of jackals. 

<sup>23</sup> 
O Lord, I know the way of man is not in himself; It is not in man who walks to direct his own steps. 

<sup>24</sup> 
O Lord, correct me, but with justice; Not in Your anger, lest You bring me to nothing. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Pour out Your fury on the Gentiles, who do not know You, And on the families who do not call on Your name; For they have eaten up Jacob, Devoured him and consumed him, And made his dwelling place desolate.
