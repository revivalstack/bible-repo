Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.

Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving; 

<sup>3</sup> 
meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains, 

<sup>4</sup> 
that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time. 

<sup>6</sup>

Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me.

<sup>9</sup> 
with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here.

Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),

<sup>12</sup> 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.

<sup>16</sup> 
Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.
