Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said: "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You, 

<sup>2</sup> 
as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. 

<sup>4</sup> 
I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.

<sup>6</sup> 
"I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are. 

<sup>12</sup> 
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one. 

<sup>16</sup> 
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth. 

<sup>18</sup> 
As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. 

<sup>19</sup> 
And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.

<sup>20</sup> 
"I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; 

<sup>21</sup> 
that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: 

<sup>23</sup> 
I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. 

<sup>24</sup> 
"Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. 

<sup>25</sup> 
O righteous Father! The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me. 

<sup>26</sup> 
And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them."
