<sup>1</sup> 
Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead. 

<sup>2</sup> 
There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray Him, said, 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" 

<sup>6</sup> 
This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also, 

<sup>11</sup> 
because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.

<sup>12</sup> 
The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 

<sup>13</sup> 
took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out: "Hosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!' The King of Israel!" 

<sup>14</sup> 
Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written: 

<sup>15</sup> 
"Fear not, daughter of Zion; Behold, your King is coming, Sitting on a donkey's colt." 

<sup>16</sup> 
His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!" 

<sup>20</sup> 
Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." 

<sup>22</sup> 
Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus. 

<sup>23</sup> 
But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. 

<sup>25</sup> 
He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 

<sup>26</sup> 
If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.

<sup>27</sup> 
"Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." 

<sup>29</sup> 
Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to Him." 

<sup>30</sup> 
Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. 

<sup>32</sup> 
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself." 

<sup>33</sup> 
This He said, signifying by what death He would die. 

<sup>34</sup> 
The people answered Him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?" 

<sup>35</sup> 
Then Jesus said to them, "A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going. 

<sup>36</sup> 
While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light." These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.

<sup>37</sup> 
But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, 

<sup>38</sup> 
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" 

<sup>39</sup> 
Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again: 

<sup>40</sup> 
"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them." 

<sup>41</sup> 
These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.

<sup>42</sup> 
Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; 

<sup>43</sup> 
for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 

<sup>44</sup> 
Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me. 

<sup>45</sup> 
And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. 

<sup>46</sup> 
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness. 

<sup>47</sup> 
And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. 

<sup>48</sup> 
He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him--the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. 

<sup>49</sup> 
For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak. 

<sup>50</sup> 
And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak."
