"These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble. 

<sup>2</sup> 
They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor Me. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them. "And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.

<sup>5</sup> 
"But now I go away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?' 

<sup>6</sup> 
But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 

<sup>9</sup> 
of sin, because they do not believe in Me; 

<sup>10</sup> 
of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; 

<sup>11</sup> 
of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 

<sup>13</sup> 
However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. 

<sup>14</sup> 
He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. 

<sup>15</sup> 
All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.

<sup>16</sup> 
"A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father." 

<sup>17</sup> 
Then some of His disciples said among themselves, "What is this that He says to us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?" 

<sup>18</sup> 
They said therefore, "What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is saying." 

<sup>19</sup> 
Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, "Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 

<sup>21</sup> 
A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
"And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.

<sup>25</sup> 
"These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you plainly about the Father. 

<sup>26</sup> 
In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; 

<sup>27</sup> 
for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God. 

<sup>28</sup> 
I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father." 

<sup>29</sup> 
His disciples said to Him, "See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech! 

<sup>30</sup> 
Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God." 

<sup>31</sup> 
Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe? 

<sup>32</sup> 
Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 

<sup>33</sup> 
These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world."
