"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 

<sup>2</sup> 
But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 

<sup>3</sup> 
To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Jesus used this illustration, but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them.

<sup>7</sup> 
Then Jesus said to them again, "Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 

<sup>8</sup> 
All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. 

<sup>9</sup> 
I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly. 

<sup>11</sup> 
"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep. 

<sup>12</sup> 
But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own. 

<sup>15</sup> 
As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again. 

<sup>18</sup> 
No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father." 

<sup>19</sup> 
Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And many of them said, "He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?" 

<sup>21</sup> 
Others said, "These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?" 

<sup>22</sup> 
Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's porch. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, "How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly." 

<sup>25</sup> 
Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, they bear witness of Me. 

<sup>26</sup> 
But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you. 

<sup>27</sup> 
My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. 

<sup>28</sup> 
And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. 

<sup>29</sup> 
My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand. 

<sup>30</sup> 
I and My Father are one." 

<sup>31</sup> 
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. 

<sup>32</sup> 
Jesus answered them, "Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?" 

<sup>33</sup> 
The Jews answered Him, saying, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God." 

<sup>34</sup> 
Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods" '? 

<sup>35</sup> 
If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken), 

<sup>36</sup> 
do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? 

<sup>37</sup> 
If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; 

<sup>38</sup> 
but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him." 

<sup>39</sup> 
Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.

<sup>40</sup> 
And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there He stayed. 

<sup>41</sup> 
Then many came to Him and said, "John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true." 

<sup>42</sup> 
And many believed in Him there.
