"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 

<sup>2</sup> 
In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And where I go you know, and the way you know." 

<sup>5</sup> 
Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?" 

<sup>6</sup> 
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.

<sup>7</sup> 
"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him." 

<sup>8</sup> 
Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us." 

<sup>9</sup> 
Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, 'Show us the Father'? 

<sup>10</sup> 
Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves.

<sup>12</sup> 
"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 

<sup>14</sup> 
If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.

<sup>15</sup> 
"If you love Me, keep My commandments. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever-- 

<sup>17</sup> 
the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 

<sup>18</sup> 
I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.

<sup>19</sup> 
"A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also. 

<sup>20</sup> 
At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. 

<sup>21</sup> 
He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him." 

<sup>22</sup> 
Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?" 

<sup>23</sup> 
Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me.

<sup>25</sup> 
"These things I have spoken to you while being present with you. 

<sup>26</sup> 
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 

<sup>28</sup> 
You have heard Me say to you, 'I am going away and coming back to you.' If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, 'I am going to the Father,' for My Father is greater than I. 

<sup>29</sup> 
"And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe. 

<sup>30</sup> 
I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me. 

<sup>31</sup> 
But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
