<sup>1</sup> 
Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. 

<sup>3</sup> 
So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving, 

<sup>5</sup> 
"for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 

<sup>9</sup> 
When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, "I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!" 

<sup>10</sup> 
And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.

<sup>11</sup> 
Now it happened, the day after, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her. 

<sup>13</sup> 
When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep." 

<sup>14</sup> 
Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise." 

<sup>15</sup> 
So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Then fear came upon all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has risen up among us"; and, "God has visited His people." 

<sup>17</sup> 
And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.

<sup>18</sup> 
Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things. 

<sup>19</sup> 
And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?" 

<sup>20</sup> 
When the men had come to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?' " 

<sup>21</sup> 
And that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me." 

<sup>24</sup> 
When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 

<sup>25</sup> 
But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts. 

<sup>26</sup> 
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 

<sup>27</sup> 
This is he of whom it is written: 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.' 

<sup>28</sup> 
For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he." 

<sup>29</sup> 
And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John. 

<sup>30</sup> 
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him. 

<sup>31</sup> 
And the Lord said, "To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like? 

<sup>32</sup> 
They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, And you did not dance; We mourned to you, And you did not weep.' 

<sup>33</sup> 
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' 

<sup>34</sup> 
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' 

<sup>35</sup> 
But wisdom is justified by all her children." 

<sup>36</sup> 
Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee's house, and sat down to eat. 

<sup>37</sup> 
And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, 

<sup>38</sup> 
and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil. 

<sup>39</sup> 
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner." 

<sup>40</sup> 
And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." So he said, "Teacher, say it." 

<sup>41</sup> 
"There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 

<sup>42</sup> 
And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?" 

<sup>43</sup> 
Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more." And He said to him, "You have rightly judged." 

<sup>44</sup> 
Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. 

<sup>45</sup> 
You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. 

<sup>46</sup> 
You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. 

<sup>47</sup> 
Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little." 

<sup>48</sup> 
Then He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." 

<sup>49</sup> 
And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" 

<sup>50</sup> 
Then He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."
