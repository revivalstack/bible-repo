<sup>1</sup> 
Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, "This Man receives sinners and eats with them." 

<sup>3</sup> 
So He spoke this parable to them, saying: 

<sup>4</sup> 
"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? 

<sup>5</sup> 
And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' 

<sup>7</sup> 
I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.

<sup>8</sup> 
"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? 

<sup>9</sup> 
And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!' 

<sup>10</sup> 
Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents." 

<sup>11</sup> 
Then He said: "A certain man had two sons. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.' So he divided to them his livelihood. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! 

<sup>18</sup> 
I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 

<sup>19</sup> 
and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants." ' 

<sup>20</sup> 
"And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 

<sup>21</sup> 
And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.' 

<sup>22</sup> 
"But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; 

<sup>24</sup> 
for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to be merry. 

<sup>25</sup> 
"Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 

<sup>26</sup> 
So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. 

<sup>27</sup> 
And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.' 

<sup>28</sup> 
"But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him. 

<sup>29</sup> 
So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends. 

<sup>30</sup> 
But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.' 

<sup>31</sup> 
"And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. 

<sup>32</sup> 
It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.' "
