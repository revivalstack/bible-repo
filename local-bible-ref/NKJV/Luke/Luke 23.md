<sup>1</sup> 
Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered him and said, "It is as you say." 

<sup>4</sup> 
So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no fault in this Man." 

<sup>5</sup> 
But they were the more fierce, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place." 

<sup>6</sup> 
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. 

<sup>12</sup> 
That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.

<sup>13</sup> 
Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, 

<sup>14</sup> 
said to them, "You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him; 

<sup>15</sup> 
no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I will therefore chastise Him and release Him" 

<sup>17</sup> 
(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast). 

<sup>18</sup> 
And they all cried out at once, saying, "Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas"-- 

<sup>19</sup> 
who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. 

<sup>21</sup> 
But they shouted, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Him!" 

<sup>22</sup> 
Then he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go." 

<sup>23</sup> 
But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed. 

<sup>24</sup> 
So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested. 

<sup>25</sup> 
And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

<sup>26</sup> 
Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus. 

<sup>27</sup> 
And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him. 

<sup>28</sup> 
But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. 

<sup>29</sup> 
For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!' 

<sup>30</sup> 
Then they will begin 'to say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!" ' 

<sup>31</sup> 
For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?" 

<sup>32</sup> 
There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. 

<sup>33</sup> 
And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do." And they divided His garments and cast lots. 

<sup>35</sup> 
And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God." 

<sup>36</sup> 
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, 

<sup>37</sup> 
and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself." 

<sup>38</sup> 
And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>39</sup> 
Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us." 

<sup>40</sup> 
But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? 

<sup>41</sup> 
And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong." 

<sup>42</sup> 
Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." 

<sup>43</sup> 
And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise." 

<sup>44</sup> 
Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 

<sup>45</sup> 
Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. 

<sup>46</sup> 
And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, "Father, 'into Your hands I commit My spirit.' " Having said this, He breathed His last. 

<sup>47</sup> 
So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!" 

<sup>48</sup> 
And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned. 

<sup>49</sup> 
But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.

<sup>50</sup> 
Now behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man. 

<sup>51</sup> 
He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God. 

<sup>52</sup> 
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 

<sup>53</sup> 
Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before. 

<sup>54</sup> 
That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near. 

<sup>55</sup> 
And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid. 

<sup>56</sup> 
Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
