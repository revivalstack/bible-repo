Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, To the oppressing city! 

<sup>2</sup> 
She has not obeyed His voice, She has not received correction; She has not trusted in the Lord, She has not drawn near to her God. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Her princes in her midst are roaring lions; Her judges are evening wolves That leave not a bone till morning. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Her prophets are insolent, treacherous people; Her priests have polluted the sanctuary, They have done violence to the law. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The Lord is righteous in her midst, He will do no unrighteousness. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He never fails, But the unjust knows no shame. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"I have cut off nations, Their fortresses are devastated; I have made their streets desolate, With none passing by. Their cities are destroyed; There is no one, no inhabitant. 

<sup>7</sup> 
I said, 'Surely you will fear Me, You will receive instruction'-- So that her dwelling would not be cut off, Despite everything for which I punished her. But they rose early and corrupted all their deeds.

<sup>8</sup> 
"Therefore wait for Me," says the Lord, "Until the day I rise up for plunder; My determination is to gather the nations To My assembly of kingdoms, To pour on them My indignation, All My fierce anger; All the earth shall be devoured With the fire of My jealousy. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language, That they all may call on the name of the Lord, To serve Him with one accord. 

<sup>10</sup> 
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, The daughter of My dispersed ones, Shall bring My offering. 

<sup>11</sup> 
In that day you shall not be shamed for any of your deeds In which you transgress against Me; For then I will take away from your midst Those who rejoice in your pride, And you shall no longer be haughty In My holy mountain. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I will leave in your midst A meek and humble people, And they shall trust in the name of the Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The remnant of Israel shall do no unrighteousness And speak no lies, Nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; For they shall feed their flocks and lie down, And no one shall make them afraid." 

<sup>14</sup> 
Sing, O daughter of Zion! Shout, O Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem! 

<sup>15</sup> 
The Lord has taken away your judgments, He has cast out your enemy. The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst; You shall see disaster no more. 

<sup>16</sup> 
In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: "Do not fear; Zion, let not your hands be weak. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The Lord your God in your midst, The Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing." 

<sup>18</sup> 
"I will gather those who sorrow over the appointed assembly, Who are among you, To whom its reproach is a burden. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Behold, at that time I will deal with all who afflict you; I will save the lame, And gather those who were driven out; I will appoint them for praise and fame In every land where they were put to shame. 

<sup>20</sup> 
At that time I will bring you back, Even at the time I gather you; For I will give you fame and praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I return your captives before your eyes," Says the Lord.
