<sup>1</sup> 
Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him, 

<sup>3</sup> 
saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!" 

<sup>4</sup> 
But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying: 

<sup>5</sup> 
"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me. 

<sup>6</sup> 
When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' 

<sup>8</sup> 
But I said, 'Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.' 

<sup>9</sup> 
But the voice answered me again from heaven, 'What God has cleansed you must not call common.' 

<sup>10</sup> 
Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven. 

<sup>11</sup> 
At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, 'Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter, 

<sup>14</sup> 
who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.' 

<sup>15</sup> 
And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 

<sup>17</sup> 
If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?" 

<sup>18</sup> 
When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life." 

<sup>19</sup> 
Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. 

<sup>20</sup> 
But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>21</sup> 
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. 

<sup>23</sup> 
When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord. 

<sup>24</sup> 
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul. 

<sup>26</sup> 
And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

<sup>27</sup> 
And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea. 

<sup>30</sup> 
This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
