Now after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. These gave evidence to the governor against Paul. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: "Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight, 

<sup>3</sup> 
we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and wanted to judge him according to our law. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands, 

<sup>8</sup> 
commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him." 

<sup>9</sup> 
And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so.

<sup>10</sup> 
Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: "Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself, 

<sup>11</sup> 
because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 

<sup>12</sup> 
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust. 

<sup>16</sup> 
This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men. 

<sup>17</sup> 
"Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation, 

<sup>18</sup> 
in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult. 

<sup>19</sup> 
They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Or else let those who are here themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council, 

<sup>21</sup> 
unless it is for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.' " 

<sup>22</sup> 
But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case." 

<sup>23</sup> 
So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him. 

<sup>24</sup> 
And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, "Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you." 

<sup>26</sup> 
Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him. 

<sup>27</sup> 
But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.
