The word of the Lord that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

<sup>2</sup> 
Hear this, you elders, And give ear, all you inhabitants of the land! Has anything like this happened in your days, Or even in the days of your fathers? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Tell your children about it, Let your children tell their children, And their children another generation. 

<sup>4</sup> 
What the chewing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten; What the swarming locust left, the crawling locust has eaten; And what the crawling locust left, the consuming locust has eaten. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Awake, you drunkards, and weep; And wail, all you drinkers of wine, Because of the new wine, For it has been cut off from your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For a nation has come up against My land, Strong, and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion, And he has the fangs of a fierce lion. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He has laid waste My vine, And ruined My fig tree; He has stripped it bare and thrown it away; Its branches are made white. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the husband of her youth. 

<sup>9</sup> 
The grain offering and the drink offering Have been cut off from the house of the Lord; The priests mourn, who minister to the Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The field is wasted, The land mourns; For the grain is ruined, The new wine is dried up, The oil fails. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Be ashamed, you farmers, Wail, you vinedressers, For the wheat and the barley; Because the harvest of the field has perished. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The vine has dried up, And the fig tree has withered; The pomegranate tree, The palm tree also, And the apple tree-- All the trees of the field are withered; Surely joy has withered away from the sons of men.

<sup>13</sup> 
Gird yourselves and lament, you priests; Wail, you who minister before the altar; Come, lie all night in sackcloth, You who minister to my God; For the grain offering and the drink offering Are withheld from the house of your God. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Consecrate a fast, Call a sacred assembly; Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land Into the house of the Lord your God, And cry out to the Lord. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Alas for the day! For the day of the Lord is at hand; It shall come as destruction from the Almighty. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Is not the food cut off before our eyes, Joy and gladness from the house of our God? 

<sup>17</sup> 
The seed shrivels under the clods, Storehouses are in shambles; Barns are broken down, For the grain has withered. 

<sup>18</sup> 
How the animals groan! The herds of cattle are restless, Because they have no pasture; Even the flocks of sheep suffer punishment. 

<sup>19</sup> 
O Lord, to You I cry out; For fire has devoured the open pastures, And a flame has burned all the trees of the field. 

<sup>20</sup> 
The beasts of the field also cry out to You, For the water brooks are dried up, And fire has devoured the open pastures.
