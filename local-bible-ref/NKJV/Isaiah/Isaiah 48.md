"Hear this, O house of Jacob, Who are called by the name of Israel, And have come forth from the wellsprings of Judah; Who swear by the name of the Lord, And make mention of the God of Israel, But not in truth or in righteousness; 

<sup>2</sup> 
For they call themselves after the holy city, And lean on the God of Israel; The Lord of hosts is His name: 

<sup>3</sup> 
"I have declared the former things from the beginning; They went forth from My mouth, and I caused them to hear it. Suddenly I did them, and they came to pass. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Because I knew that you were obstinate, And your neck was an iron sinew, And your brow bronze, 

<sup>5</sup> 
Even from the beginning I have declared it to you; Before it came to pass I proclaimed it to you, Lest you should say, 'My idol has done them, And my carved image and my molded image Have commanded them.' 

<sup>6</sup> 
"You have heard; See all this. And will you not declare it? I have made you hear new things from this time, Even hidden things, and you did not know them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They are created now and not from the beginning; And before this day you have not heard them, Lest you should say, 'Of course I knew them.' 

<sup>8</sup> 
Surely you did not hear, Surely you did not know; Surely from long ago your ear was not opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, And were called a transgressor from the womb. 

<sup>9</sup> 
"For My name's sake I will defer My anger, And for My praise I will restrain it from you, So that I do not cut you off. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it; For how should My name be profaned? And I will not give My glory to another.

<sup>12</sup> 
"Listen to Me, O Jacob, And Israel, My called: I am He, I am the First, I am also the Last. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Indeed My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, And My right hand has stretched out the heavens; When I call to them, They stand up together. 

<sup>14</sup> 
"All of you, assemble yourselves, and hear! Who among them has declared these things? The Lord loves him; He shall do His pleasure on Babylon, And His arm shall be against the Chaldeans. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I, even I, have spoken; Yes, I have called him, I have brought him, and his way will prosper. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord God and His Spirit Have sent Me." 

<sup>17</sup> 
Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: "I am the Lord your God, Who teaches you to profit, Who leads you by the way you should go. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Oh, that you had heeded My commandments! Then your peace would have been like a river, And your righteousness like the waves of the sea. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Your descendants also would have been like the sand, And the offspring of your body like the grains of sand; His name would not have been cut off Nor destroyed from before Me." 

<sup>20</sup> 
Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! With a voice of singing, Declare, proclaim this, Utter it to the end of the earth; Say, "The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob!" 

<sup>21</sup> 
And they did not thirst When He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow from the rock for them; He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out. 

<sup>22</sup> 
"There is no peace," says the Lord, "for the wicked."
