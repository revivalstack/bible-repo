In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; God will appoint salvation for walls and bulwarks. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Open the gates, That the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Trust in the Lord forever, For in Yah, the Lord, is everlasting strength. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For He brings down those who dwell on high, The lofty city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He brings it down to the dust. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The foot shall tread it down-- The feet of the poor And the steps of the needy." 

<sup>7</sup> 
The way of the just is uprightness; O Most Upright, You weigh the path of the just. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Yes, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, we have waited for You; The desire of our soul is for Your name And for the remembrance of You. 

<sup>9</sup> 
With my soul I have desired You in the night, Yes, by my spirit within me I will seek You early; For when Your judgments are in the earth, The inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Let grace be shown to the wicked, Yet he will not learn righteousness; In the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly, And will not behold the majesty of the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Lord, when Your hand is lifted up, they will not see. But they will see and be ashamed For their envy of people; Yes, the fire of Your enemies shall devour them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Lord, You will establish peace for us, For You have also done all our works in us. 

<sup>13</sup> 
O Lord our God, masters besides You Have had dominion over us; But by You only we make mention of Your name. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They are dead, they will not live; They are deceased, they will not rise. Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And made all their memory to perish. 

<sup>15</sup> 
You have increased the nation, O Lord, You have increased the nation; You are glorified; You have expanded all the borders of the land. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Lord, in trouble they have visited You, They poured out a prayer when Your chastening was upon them. 

<sup>17</sup> 
As a woman with child Is in pain and cries out in her pangs, When she draws near the time of her delivery, So have we been in Your sight, O Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 
We have been with child, we have been in pain; We have, as it were, brought forth wind; We have not accomplished any deliverance in the earth, Nor have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Your dead shall live; Together with my dead body they shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust; For your dew is like the dew of herbs, And the earth shall cast out the dead.

<sup>20</sup> 
Come, my people, enter your chambers, And shut your doors behind you; Hide yourself, as it were, for a little moment, Until the indignation is past. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For behold, the Lord comes out of His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; The earth will also disclose her blood, And will no more cover her slain.
