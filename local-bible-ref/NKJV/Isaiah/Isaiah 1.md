The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

<sup>2</sup> 
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me; 

<sup>3</sup> 
The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master's crib; But Israel does not know, My people do not consider." 

<sup>4</sup> 
Alas, sinful nation, A people laden with iniquity, A brood of evildoers, Children who are corrupters! They have forsaken the Lord, They have provoked to anger The Holy One of Israel, They have turned away backward. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Why should you be stricken again? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faints. 

<sup>6</sup> 
From the sole of the foot even to the head, There is no soundness in it, But wounds and bruises and putrefying sores; They have not been closed or bound up, Or soothed with ointment. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Your country is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire; Strangers devour your land in your presence; And it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 

<sup>8</sup> 
So the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Unless the Lord of hosts Had left to us a very small remnant, We would have become like Sodom, We would have been made like Gomorrah. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Hear the word of the Lord, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the law of our God, You people of Gomorrah: 

<sup>11</sup> 
"To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?" Says the Lord. "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, Or of lambs or goats. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"When you come to appear before Me, Who has required this from your hand, To trample My courts? 

<sup>13</sup> 
Bring no more futile sacrifices; Incense is an abomination to Me. The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them. 

<sup>15</sup> 
When you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; Even though you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. 

<sup>16</sup> 
"Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor; Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow. 

<sup>18</sup> 
"Come now, and let us reason together," Says the Lord, "Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool. 

<sup>19</sup> 
If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land; 

<sup>20</sup> 
But if you refuse and rebel, You shall be devoured by the sword"; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

<sup>21</sup> 
How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; Righteousness lodged in it, But now murderers. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Your silver has become dross, Your wine mixed with water. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Your princes are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes, And follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the cause of the widow come before them. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Therefore the Lord says, The Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, "Ah, I will rid Myself of My adversaries, And take vengeance on My enemies. 

<sup>25</sup> 
I will turn My hand against you, And thoroughly purge away your dross, And take away all your alloy. 

<sup>26</sup> 
I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city." 

<sup>27</sup> 
Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And her penitents with righteousness. 

<sup>28</sup> 
The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together, And those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed. 

<sup>29</sup> 
For they shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees Which you have desired; And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens Which you have chosen. 

<sup>30</sup> 
For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades, And as a garden that has no water. 

<sup>31</sup> 
The strong shall be as tinder, And the work of it as a spark; Both will burn together, And no one shall quench them.
