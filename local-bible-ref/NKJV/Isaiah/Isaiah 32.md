<sup>1</sup> 
Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, And princes will rule with justice. 

<sup>2</sup> 
A man will be as a hiding place from the wind, And a cover from the tempest, As rivers of water in a dry place, As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The eyes of those who see will not be dim, And the ears of those who hear will listen. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Also the heart of the rash will understand knowledge, And the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The foolish person will no longer be called generous, Nor the miser said to be bountiful; 

<sup>6</sup> 
For the foolish person will speak foolishness, And his heart will work iniquity: To practice ungodliness, To utter error against the Lord, To keep the hungry unsatisfied, And he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Also the schemes of the schemer are evil; He devises wicked plans To destroy the poor with lying words, Even when the needy speaks justice. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But a generous man devises generous things, And by generosity he shall stand.

<sup>9</sup> 
Rise up, you women who are at ease, Hear my voice; You complacent daughters, Give ear to my speech. 

<sup>10</sup> 
In a year and some days You will be troubled, you complacent women; For the vintage will fail, The gathering will not come. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Tremble, you women who are at ease; Be troubled, you complacent ones; Strip yourselves, make yourselves bare, And gird sackcloth on your waists. 

<sup>12</sup> 
People shall mourn upon their breasts For the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 

<sup>13</sup> 
On the land of my people will come up thorns and briers, Yes, on all the happy homes in the joyous city; 

<sup>14</sup> 
Because the palaces will be forsaken, The bustling city will be deserted. The forts and towers will become lairs forever, A joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks-- 

<sup>15</sup> 
Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, And the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, And the fruitful field is counted as a forest.

<sup>16</sup> 
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness, And righteousness remain in the fruitful field. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The work of righteousness will be peace, And the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever. 

<sup>18</sup> 
My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, In secure dwellings, and in quiet resting places, 

<sup>19</sup> 
Though hail comes down on the forest, And the city is brought low in humiliation. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, Who send out freely the feet of the ox and the donkey.
