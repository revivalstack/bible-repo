In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And one cried to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!" 

<sup>4</sup> 
And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke. 

<sup>5</sup> 
So I said: "Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, The Lord of hosts." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And he touched my mouth with it, and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin purged." 

<sup>8</sup> 
Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: "Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me." 

<sup>9</sup> 
And He said, "Go, and tell this people: 'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.' 

<sup>10</sup> 
"Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And return and be healed." 

<sup>11</sup> 
Then I said, "Lord, how long?" And He answered: "Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, The houses are without a man, The land is utterly desolate, 

<sup>12</sup> 
The Lord has removed men far away, And the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But yet a tenth will be in it, And will return and be for consuming, As a terebinth tree or as an oak, Whose stump remains when it is cut down. So the holy seed shall be its stump."
