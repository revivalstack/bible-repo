The burden against the Wilderness of the Sea. As whirlwinds in the South pass through, So it comes from the desert, from a terrible land. 

<sup>2</sup> 
A distressing vision is declared to me; The treacherous dealer deals treacherously, And the plunderer plunders. Go up, O Elam! Besiege, O Media! All its sighing I have made to cease. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Therefore my loins are filled with pain; Pangs have taken hold of me, like the pangs of a woman in labor. I was distressed when I heard it; I was dismayed when I saw it. 

<sup>4</sup> 
My heart wavered, fearfulness frightened me; The night for which I longed He turned into fear for me. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Prepare the table, Set a watchman in the tower, Eat and drink. Arise, you princes, Anoint the shield! 

<sup>6</sup> 
For thus has the Lord said to me: "Go, set a watchman, Let him declare what he sees." 

<sup>7</sup> 
And he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, A chariot of donkeys, and a chariot of camels, And he listened earnestly with great care. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Then he cried, "A lion, my Lord! I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime; I have sat at my post every night. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And look, here comes a chariot of men with a pair of horsemen!" Then he answered and said, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen! And all the carved images of her gods He has broken to the ground." 

<sup>10</sup> 
Oh, my threshing and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from the Lord of hosts, The God of Israel, I have declared to you.

<sup>11</sup> 
The burden against Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?" 

<sup>12</sup> 
The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; Return! Come back!" 

<sup>13</sup> 
The burden against Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, O you traveling companies of Dedanites. 

<sup>14</sup> 
O inhabitants of the land of Tema, Bring water to him who is thirsty; With their bread they met him who fled. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, From the bent bow, and from the distress of war. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For thus the Lord has said to me: "Within a year, according to the year of a hired man, all the glory of Kedar will fail; 

<sup>17</sup> 
and the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the people of Kedar, will be diminished; for the Lord God of Israel has spoken it."
