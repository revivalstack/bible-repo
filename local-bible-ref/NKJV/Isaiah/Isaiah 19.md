The burden against Egypt. Behold, the Lord rides on a swift cloud, And will come into Egypt; The idols of Egypt will totter at His presence, And the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst. 

<sup>2</sup> 
"I will set Egyptians against Egyptians; Everyone will fight against his brother, And everyone against his neighbor, City against city, kingdom against kingdom. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst; I will destroy their counsel, And they will consult the idols and the charmers, The mediums and the sorcerers. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And the Egyptians I will give Into the hand of a cruel master, And a fierce king will rule over them," Says the Lord, the Lord of hosts. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The waters will fail from the sea, And the river will be wasted and dried up. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The rivers will turn foul; The brooks of defense will be emptied and dried up; The reeds and rushes will wither. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The papyrus reeds by the River, by the mouth of the River, And everything sown by the River, Will wither, be driven away, and be no more. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The fishermen also will mourn; All those will lament who cast hooks into the River, And they will languish who spread nets on the waters. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Moreover those who work in fine flax And those who weave fine fabric will be ashamed; 

<sup>10</sup> 
And its foundations will be broken. All who make wages will be troubled of soul. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; Pharaoh's wise counselors give foolish counsel. How do you say to Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise, The son of ancient kings?" 

<sup>12</sup> 
Where are they? Where are your wise men? Let them tell you now, And let them know what the Lord of hosts has purposed against Egypt. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The princes of Zoan have become fools; The princes of Noph are deceived; They have also deluded Egypt, Those who are the mainstay of its tribes. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The Lord has mingled a perverse spirit in her midst; And they have caused Egypt to err in all her work, As a drunken man staggers in his vomit. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Neither will there be any work for Egypt, Which the head or tail, Palm branch or bulrush, may do. 

<sup>16</sup> 
In that day Egypt will be like women, and will be afraid and fear because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which He waves over it. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And the land of Judah will be a terror to Egypt; everyone who makes mention of it will be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the Lord of hosts which He has determined against it.

<sup>18</sup> 
In that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear by the Lord of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> 
In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Lord at its border. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And it will be for a sign and for a witness to the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the Lord because of the oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Mighty One, and He will deliver them. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Then the Lord will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the Lord in that day, and will make sacrifice and offering; yes, they will make a vow to the Lord and perform it. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And the Lord will strike Egypt, He will strike and heal it; they will return to the Lord, and He will be entreated by them and heal them. 

<sup>23</sup> 
In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will serve with the Assyrians. 

<sup>24</sup> 
In that day Israel will be one of three with Egypt and Assyria--a blessing in the midst of the land, 

<sup>25</sup> 
whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, "Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance."
