O Lord, You are my God. I will exalt You, I will praise Your name, For You have done wonderful things; Your counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For You have made a city a ruin, A fortified city a ruin, A palace of foreigners to be a city no more; It will never be rebuilt. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Therefore the strong people will glorify You; The city of the terrible nations will fear You. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For You have been a strength to the poor, A strength to the needy in his distress, A refuge from the storm, A shade from the heat; For the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You will reduce the noise of aliens, As heat in a dry place; As heat in the shadow of a cloud, The song of the terrible ones will be diminished. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And in this mountain The Lord of hosts will make for all people A feast of choice pieces, A feast of wines on the lees, Of fat things full of marrow, Of well-refined wines on the lees. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And He will destroy on this mountain The surface of the covering cast over all people, And the veil that is spread over all nations. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He will swallow up death forever, And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces; The rebuke of His people He will take away from all the earth; For the Lord has spoken. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And it will be said in that day: "Behold, this is our God; We have waited for Him, and He will save us. This is the Lord; We have waited for Him; We will be glad and rejoice in His salvation." 

<sup>10</sup> 
For on this mountain the hand of the Lord will rest, And Moab shall be trampled down under Him, As straw is trampled down for the refuse heap. 

<sup>11</sup> 
And He will spread out His hands in their midst As a swimmer reaches out to swim, And He will bring down their pride Together with the trickery of their hands. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The fortress of the high fort of your walls He will bring down, lay low, And bring to the ground, down to the dust.
