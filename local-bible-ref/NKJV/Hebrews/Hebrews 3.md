<sup>1</sup> 
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus, 

<sup>2</sup> 
who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward, 

<sup>6</sup> 
but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you will hear His voice, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, 

<sup>9</sup> 
Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me, And saw My works forty years. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways.' 

<sup>11</sup> 
So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.' " 

<sup>12</sup> 
Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; 

<sup>13</sup> 
but exhort one another daily, while it is called "Today," lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, 

<sup>15</sup> 
while it is said: "Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion." 

<sup>16</sup> 
For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness? 

<sup>18</sup> 
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey? 

<sup>19</sup> 
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
