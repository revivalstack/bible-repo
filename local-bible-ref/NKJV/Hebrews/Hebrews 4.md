<sup>1</sup> 
Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said: "So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest,' " although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works"; 

<sup>5</sup> 
and again in this place: "They shall not enter My rest." 

<sup>6</sup> 
Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, 

<sup>7</sup> 
again He designates a certain day, saying in David, "Today," after such a long time, as it has been said: "Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts." 

<sup>8</sup> 
For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day. 

<sup>9</sup> 
There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.

<sup>11</sup> 
Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

<sup>14</sup> 
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
