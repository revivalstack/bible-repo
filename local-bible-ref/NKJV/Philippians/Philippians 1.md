Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 

<sup>2</sup> 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>3</sup> 
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 

<sup>4</sup> 
always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy, 

<sup>5</sup> 
for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, 

<sup>6</sup> 
being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ; 

<sup>7</sup> 
just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, 

<sup>10</sup> 
that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, 

<sup>11</sup> 
being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

<sup>12</sup> 
But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, 

<sup>13</sup> 
so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; 

<sup>14</sup> 
and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill: 

<sup>16</sup> 
The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 

<sup>17</sup> 
but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. 

<sup>18</sup> 
What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.

<sup>19</sup> 
For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 

<sup>20</sup> 
according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you. 

<sup>25</sup> 
And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith, 

<sup>26</sup> 
that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.

<sup>27</sup> 
Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel, 

<sup>28</sup> 
and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God. 

<sup>29</sup> 
For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, 

<sup>30</sup> 
having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
