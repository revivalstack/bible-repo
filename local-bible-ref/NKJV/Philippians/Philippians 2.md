<sup>1</sup> 
Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, 

<sup>2</sup> 
fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.

<sup>5</sup> 
Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> 
who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, 

<sup>7</sup> 
but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. 

<sup>8</sup> 
And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 

<sup>10</sup> 
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, 

<sup>11</sup> 
and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

<sup>12</sup> 
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 

<sup>13</sup> 
for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Do all things without complaining and disputing, 

<sup>15</sup> 
that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 

<sup>16</sup> 
holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.

<sup>19</sup> 
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state. 

<sup>20</sup> 
For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me. 

<sup>24</sup> 
But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.

<sup>25</sup> 
Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need; 

<sup>26</sup> 
since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem; 

<sup>30</sup> 
because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.
