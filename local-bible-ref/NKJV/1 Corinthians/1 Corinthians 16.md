Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also: 

<sup>2</sup> 
On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.

<sup>5</sup> 
Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia). 

<sup>6</sup> 
And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey, wherever I go. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but he was quite unwilling to come at this time; however, he will come when he has a convenient time.

<sup>13</sup> 
Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Let all that you do be done with love. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I urge you, brethren--you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints-- 

<sup>16</sup> 
that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.

<sup>19</sup> 
The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 

<sup>20</sup> 
All the brethren greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The salutation with my own hand--Paul's. 

<sup>22</sup> 
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. O Lord, come! 

<sup>23</sup> 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

<sup>24</sup> 
My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
