Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: 

<sup>2</sup> 
You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>4</sup> 
There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 

<sup>5</sup> 
There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: 

<sup>8</sup> 
for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, 

<sup>9</sup> 
to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 

<sup>10</sup> 
to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.

<sup>12</sup> 
For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free--and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For in fact the body is not one member but many. 

<sup>15</sup> 
If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 

<sup>16</sup> 
And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body," is it therefore not of the body? 

<sup>17</sup> 
If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling? 

<sup>18</sup> 
But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. 

<sup>19</sup> 
And if they were all one member, where would the body be? 

<sup>20</sup> 
But now indeed there are many members, yet one body. 

<sup>21</sup> 
And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you." 

<sup>22</sup> 
No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty, 

<sup>24</sup> 
but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it, 

<sup>25</sup> 
that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. 

<sup>26</sup> 
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. 

<sup>28</sup> 
And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 

<sup>30</sup> 
Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 

<sup>31</sup> 
But earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way.
