<sup>1</sup> 
And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. 

<sup>2</sup> 
I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; 

<sup>3</sup> 
for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? 

<sup>4</sup> 
For when one says, "I am of Paul," and another, "I am of Apollos," are you not carnal? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one? 

<sup>6</sup> 
I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. 

<sup>7</sup> 
So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, you are God's building. 

<sup>10</sup> 
According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 

<sup>13</sup> 
each one's work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one's work, of what sort it is. 

<sup>14</sup> 
If anyone's work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. 

<sup>15</sup> 
If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? 

<sup>17</sup> 
If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.

<sup>18</sup> 
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. 

<sup>19</sup> 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their own craftiness"; 

<sup>20</sup> 
and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile." 

<sup>21</sup> 
Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours: 

<sup>22</sup> 
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come--all are yours. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
