<sup>1</sup> 
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 

<sup>5</sup> 
does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 

<sup>6</sup> 
does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 

<sup>7</sup> 
bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 

<sup>10</sup> 
But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. 

<sup>11</sup> 
When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. 

<sup>13</sup> 
And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
