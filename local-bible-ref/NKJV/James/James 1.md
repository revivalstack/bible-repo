James, a bondservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad: Greetings.

<sup>2</sup> 
My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 

<sup>3</sup> 
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. 

<sup>5</sup> 
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 

<sup>6</sup> 
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 

<sup>8</sup> 
he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

<sup>9</sup> 
Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, 

<sup>10</sup> 
but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.

<sup>12</sup> 
Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.

<sup>19</sup> 
So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 

<sup>20</sup> 
for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.

<sup>21</sup> 
Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; 

<sup>24</sup> 
for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 

<sup>25</sup> 
But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. 

<sup>26</sup> 
If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is useless. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.
