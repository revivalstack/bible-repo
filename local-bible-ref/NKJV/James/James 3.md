<sup>1</sup> 
My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Indeed, we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles! 

<sup>6</sup> 
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 

<sup>9</sup> 
With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening? 

<sup>12</sup> 
Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.

<sup>13</sup> 
Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 

<sup>15</sup> 
This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there. 

<sup>17</sup> 
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
