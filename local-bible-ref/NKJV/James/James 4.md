Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members? 

<sup>2</sup> 
You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously"? 

<sup>6</sup> 
But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: "God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble." 

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.

<sup>11</sup> 
Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. He who speaks evil of a brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. 

<sup>12</sup> 
There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another? 

<sup>13</sup> 
Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit"; 

<sup>14</sup> 
whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that." 

<sup>16</sup> 
But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.
