<sup>1</sup> 
But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. 

<sup>2</sup> 
For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For when they say, "Peace and safety!" then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 

<sup>5</sup> 
You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. 

<sup>7</sup> 
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. 

<sup>9</sup> 
For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>10</sup> 
who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.

<sup>12</sup> 
And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 

<sup>13</sup> 
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all. 

<sup>15</sup> 
See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Rejoice always, 

<sup>17</sup> 
pray without ceasing, 

<sup>18</sup> 
in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Do not quench the Spirit. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Do not despise prophecies. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Test all things; hold fast what is good. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Abstain from every form of evil.

<sup>23</sup> 
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Brethren, pray for us. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss. 

<sup>27</sup> 
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren. 

<sup>28</sup> 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
