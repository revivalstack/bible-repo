<sup>1</sup> 
We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me." 

<sup>4</sup> 
For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> 
that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, 

<sup>9</sup> 
and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: "For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, And sing to Your name." 

<sup>10</sup> 
And again he says: "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!" 

<sup>11</sup> 
And again: "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles! Laud Him, all you peoples!" 

<sup>12</sup> 
And again, Isaiah says: "There shall be a root of Jesse; And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, In Him the Gentiles shall hope." 

<sup>13</sup> 
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

<sup>14</sup> 
Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God, 

<sup>16</sup> 
that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, in word and deed, to make the Gentiles obedient-- 

<sup>19</sup> 
in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man's foundation, 

<sup>21</sup> 
but as it is written: "To whom He was not announced, they shall see; And those who have not heard shall understand." 

<sup>22</sup> 
For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
But now no longer having a place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you, 

<sup>24</sup> 
whenever I journey to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while. 

<sup>25</sup> 
But now I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. 

<sup>26</sup> 
For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem. 

<sup>27</sup> 
It pleased them indeed, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in material things. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain. 

<sup>29</sup> 
But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me, 

<sup>31</sup> 
that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, 

<sup>32</sup> 
that I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
