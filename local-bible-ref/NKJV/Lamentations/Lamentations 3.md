<sup>1</sup> 
I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of His wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> 
He has led me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Surely He has turned His hand against me Time and time again throughout the day. 

<sup>4</sup> 
He has aged my flesh and my skin, And broken my bones. 

<sup>5</sup> 
He has besieged me And surrounded me with bitterness and woe. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He has set me in dark places Like the dead of long ago. 

<sup>7</sup> 
He has hedged me in so that I cannot get out; He has made my chain heavy. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Even when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked. 

<sup>10</sup> 
He has been to me a bear lying in wait, Like a lion in ambush. 

<sup>11</sup> 
He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces; He has made me desolate. 

<sup>12</sup> 
He has bent His bow And set me up as a target for the arrow. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He has caused the arrows of His quiver To pierce my loins. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I have become the ridicule of all my people-- Their taunting song all the day. 

<sup>15</sup> 
He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drink wormwood. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He has also broken my teeth with gravel, And covered me with ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> 
You have moved my soul far from peace; I have forgotten prosperity. 

<sup>18</sup> 
And I said, "My strength and my hope Have perished from the Lord." 

<sup>19</sup> 
Remember my affliction and roaming, The wormwood and the gall. 

<sup>20</sup> 
My soul still remembers And sinks within me. 

<sup>21</sup> 
This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Through the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, Because His compassions fail not. 

<sup>23</sup> 
They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness. 

<sup>24</sup> 
"The Lord is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I hope in Him!" 

<sup>25</sup> 
The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, To the soul who seeks Him. 

<sup>26</sup> 
It is good that one should hope and wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord. 

<sup>27</sup> 
It is good for a man to bear The yoke in his youth. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Let him sit alone and keep silent, Because God has laid it on him; 

<sup>29</sup> 
Let him put his mouth in the dust-- There may yet be hope. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him, And be full of reproach. 

<sup>31</sup> 
For the Lord will not cast off forever. 

<sup>32</sup> 
Though He causes grief, Yet He will show compassion According to the multitude of His mercies. 

<sup>33</sup> 
For He does not afflict willingly, Nor grieve the children of men. 

<sup>34</sup> 
To crush under one's feet All the prisoners of the earth, 

<sup>35</sup> 
To turn aside the justice due a man Before the face of the Most High, 

<sup>36</sup> 
Or subvert a man in his cause-- The Lord does not approve. 

<sup>37</sup> 
Who is he who speaks and it comes to pass, When the Lord has not commanded it? 

<sup>38</sup> 
Is it not from the mouth of the Most High That woe and well-being proceed? 

<sup>39</sup> 
Why should a living man complain, A man for the punishment of his sins? 

<sup>40</sup> 
Let us search out and examine our ways, And turn back to the Lord; 

<sup>41</sup> 
Let us lift our hearts and hands To God in heaven. 

<sup>42</sup> 
We have transgressed and rebelled; You have not pardoned. 

<sup>43</sup> 
You have covered Yourself with anger And pursued us; You have slain and not pitied. 

<sup>44</sup> 
You have covered Yourself with a cloud, That prayer should not pass through. 

<sup>45</sup> 
You have made us an offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples. 

<sup>46</sup> 
All our enemies Have opened their mouths against us. 

<sup>47</sup> 
Fear and a snare have come upon us, Desolation and destruction. 

<sup>48</sup> 
My eyes overflow with rivers of water For the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> 
My eyes flow and do not cease, Without interruption, 

<sup>50</sup> 
Till the Lord from heaven Looks down and sees. 

<sup>51</sup> 
My eyes bring suffering to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. 

<sup>52</sup> 
My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird. 

<sup>53</sup> 
They silenced my life in the pit And threw stones at me. 

<sup>54</sup> 
The waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!" 

<sup>55</sup> 
I called on Your name, O Lord, From the lowest pit. 

<sup>56</sup> 
You have heard my voice: "Do not hide Your ear From my sighing, from my cry for help." 

<sup>57</sup> 
You drew near on the day I called on You, And said, "Do not fear!" 

<sup>58</sup> 
O Lord, You have pleaded the case for my soul; You have redeemed my life. 

<sup>59</sup> 
O Lord, You have seen how I am wronged; Judge my case. 

<sup>60</sup> 
You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. 

<sup>61</sup> 
You have heard their reproach, O Lord, All their schemes against me, 

<sup>62</sup> 
The lips of my enemies And their whispering against me all the day. 

<sup>63</sup> 
Look at their sitting down and their rising up; I am their taunting song. 

<sup>64</sup> 
Repay them, O Lord, According to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> 
Give them a veiled heart; Your curse be upon them! 

<sup>66</sup> 
In Your anger, Pursue and destroy them From under the heavens of the Lord.
