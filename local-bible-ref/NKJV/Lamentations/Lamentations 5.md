<sup>1</sup> 
Remember, O Lord, what has come upon us; Look, and behold our reproach! 

<sup>2</sup> 
Our inheritance has been turned over to aliens, And our houses to foreigners. 

<sup>3</sup> 
We have become orphans and waifs, Our mothers are like widows. 

<sup>4</sup> 
We pay for the water we drink, And our wood comes at a price. 

<sup>5</sup> 
They pursue at our heels; We labor and have no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> 
We have given our hand to the Egyptians And the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Our fathers sinned and are no more, But we bear their iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Servants rule over us; There is none to deliver us from their hand. 

<sup>9</sup> 
We get our bread at the risk of our lives, Because of the sword in the wilderness. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Our skin is hot as an oven, Because of the fever of famine. 

<sup>11</sup> 
They ravished the women in Zion, The maidens in the cities of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Princes were hung up by their hands, And elders were not respected. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Young men ground at the millstones; Boys staggered under loads of wood. 

<sup>14</sup> 
The elders have ceased gathering at the gate, And the young men from their music. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The joy of our heart has ceased; Our dance has turned into mourning. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

<sup>17</sup> 
Because of this our heart is faint; Because of these things our eyes grow dim; 

<sup>18</sup> 
Because of Mount Zion which is desolate, With foxes walking about on it. 

<sup>19</sup> 
You, O Lord, remain forever; Your throne from generation to generation. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Why do You forget us forever, And forsake us for so long a time? 

<sup>21</sup> 
Turn us back to You, O Lord, and we will be restored; Renew our days as of old, 

<sup>22</sup> 
Unless You have utterly rejected us, And are very angry with us!
