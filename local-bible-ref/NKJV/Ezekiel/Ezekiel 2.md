And He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you." 

<sup>2</sup> 
Then the Spirit entered me when He spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard Him who spoke to me. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And He said to me: "Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me to this very day. 

<sup>4</sup> 
For they are impudent and stubborn children. I am sending you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God.' 

<sup>5</sup> 
As for them, whether they hear or whether they refuse--for they are a rebellious house--yet they will know that a prophet has been among them. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you dwell among scorpions; do not be afraid of their words or dismayed by their looks, though they are a rebellious house. 

<sup>7</sup> 
You shall speak My words to them, whether they hear or whether they refuse, for they are rebellious. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I give you."

Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Then He spread it before me; and there was writing on the inside and on the outside, and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
