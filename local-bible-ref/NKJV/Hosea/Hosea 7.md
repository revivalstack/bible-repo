"When I would have healed Israel, Then the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, And the wickedness of Samaria. For they have committed fraud; A thief comes in; A band of robbers takes spoil outside. 

<sup>2</sup> 
They do not consider in their hearts That I remember all their wickedness; Now their own deeds have surrounded them; They are before My face. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They make a king glad with their wickedness, And princes with their lies. 

<sup>4</sup> 
"They are all adulterers. Like an oven heated by a baker-- He ceases stirring the fire after kneading the dough, Until it is leavened. 

<sup>5</sup> 
In the day of our king Princes have made him sick, inflamed with wine; He stretched out his hand with scoffers. 

<sup>6</sup> 
They prepare their heart like an oven, While they lie in wait; Their baker sleeps all night; In the morning it burns like a flaming fire. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They are all hot, like an oven, And have devoured their judges; All their kings have fallen. None among them calls upon Me. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Ephraim has mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake unturned. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Aliens have devoured his strength, But he does not know it; Yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, Yet he does not know it. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And the pride of Israel testifies to his face, But they do not return to the Lord their God, Nor seek Him for all this.

<sup>11</sup> 
"Ephraim also is like a silly dove, without sense-- They call to Egypt, They go to Assyria. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Wherever they go, I will spread My net on them; I will bring them down like birds of the air; I will chastise them According to what their congregation has heard. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"Woe to them, for they have fled from Me! Destruction to them, Because they have transgressed against Me! Though I redeemed them, Yet they have spoken lies against Me. 

<sup>14</sup> 
They did not cry out to Me with their heart When they wailed upon their beds. "They assemble together for grain and new wine, They rebel against Me; 

<sup>15</sup> 
Though I disciplined and strengthened their arms, Yet they devise evil against Me; 

<sup>16</sup> 
They return, but not to the Most High; They are like a treacherous bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword For the cursings of their tongue. This shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
