Israel empties his vine; He brings forth fruit for himself. According to the multitude of his fruit He has increased the altars; According to the bounty of his land They have embellished his sacred pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Their heart is divided; Now they are held guilty. He will break down their altars; He will ruin their sacred pillars. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For now they say, "We have no king, Because we did not fear the Lord. And as for a king, what would he do for us?" 

<sup>4</sup> 
They have spoken words, Swearing falsely in making a covenant. Thus judgment springs up like hemlock in the furrows of the field. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The inhabitants of Samaria fear Because of the calf of Beth Aven. For its people mourn for it, And its priests shriek for it-- Because its glory has departed from it. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The idol also shall be carried to Assyria As a present for King Jareb. Ephraim shall receive shame, And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 

<sup>7</sup> 
As for Samaria, her king is cut off Like a twig on the water. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, Shall be destroyed. The thorn and thistle shall grow on their altars; They shall say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" 

<sup>9</sup> 
"O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah; There they stood. The battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity Did not overtake them. 

<sup>10</sup> 
When it is My desire, I will chasten them. Peoples shall be gathered against them When I bind them for their two transgressions. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Ephraim is a trained heifer That loves to thresh grain; But I harnessed her fair neck, I will make Ephraim pull a plow. Judah shall plow; Jacob shall break his clods." 

<sup>12</sup> 
Sow for yourselves righteousness; Reap in mercy; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the Lord, Till He comes and rains righteousness on you. 

<sup>13</sup> 
You have plowed wickedness; You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies, Because you trusted in your own way, In the multitude of your mighty men. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Therefore tumult shall arise among your people, And all your fortresses shall be plundered As Shalman plundered Beth Arbel in the day of battle-- A mother dashed in pieces upon her children. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Thus it shall be done to you, O Bethel, Because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel Shall be cut off utterly.
