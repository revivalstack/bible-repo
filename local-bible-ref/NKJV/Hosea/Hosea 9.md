<sup>1</sup> 
Do not rejoice, O Israel, with joy like other peoples, For you have played the harlot against your God. You have made love for hire on every threshing floor. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The threshing floor and the winepress Shall not feed them, And the new wine shall fail in her. 

<sup>3</sup> 
They shall not dwell in the Lord's land, But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And shall eat unclean things in Assyria. 

<sup>4</sup> 
They shall not offer wine offerings to the Lord, Nor shall their sacrifices be pleasing to Him. It shall be like bread of mourners to them; All who eat it shall be defiled. For their bread shall be for their own life; It shall not come into the house of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 
What will you do in the appointed day, And in the day of the feast of the Lord? 

<sup>6</sup> 
For indeed they are gone because of destruction. Egypt shall gather them up; Memphis shall bury them. Nettles shall possess their valuables of silver; Thorns shall be in their tents. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The days of punishment have come; The days of recompense have come. Israel knows! The prophet is a fool, The spiritual man is insane, Because of the greatness of your iniquity and great enmity. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The watchman of Ephraim is with my God; But the prophet is a fowler's snare in all his ways-- Enmity in the house of his God. 

<sup>9</sup> 
They are deeply corrupted, As in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity; He will punish their sins. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"I found Israel Like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers As the firstfruits on the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal Peor, And separated themselves to that shame; They became an abomination like the thing they loved. 

<sup>11</sup> 
As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception! 

<sup>12</sup> 
Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! 

<sup>13</sup> 
Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place, So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer." 

<sup>14</sup> 
Give them, O Lord-- What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb And dry breasts! 

<sup>15</sup> 
"All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house; I will love them no more. All their princes are rebellious. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Ephraim is stricken, Their root is dried up; They shall bear no fruit. Yes, were they to bear children, I would kill the darlings of their womb." 

<sup>17</sup> 
My God will cast them away, Because they did not obey Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations.
