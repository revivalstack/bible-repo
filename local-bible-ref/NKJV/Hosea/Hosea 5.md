"Hear this, O priests! Take heed, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For yours is the judgment, Because you have been a snare to Mizpah And a net spread on Tabor. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The revolters are deeply involved in slaughter, Though I rebuke them all. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I know Ephraim, And Israel is not hidden from Me; For now, O Ephraim, you commit harlotry; Israel is defiled. 

<sup>4</sup> 
"They do not direct their deeds Toward turning to their God, For the spirit of harlotry is in their midst, And they do not know the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 
The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Therefore Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity; Judah also stumbles with them. 

<sup>6</sup> 
"With their flocks and herds They shall go to seek the Lord, But they will not find Him; He has withdrawn Himself from them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
They have dealt treacherously with the Lord, For they have begotten pagan children. Now a New Moon shall devour them and their heritage. 

<sup>8</sup> 
"Blow the ram's horn in Gibeah, The trumpet in Ramah! Cry aloud at Beth Aven, 'Look behind you, O Benjamin!' 

<sup>9</sup> 
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark; I will pour out My wrath on them like water. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, Because he willingly walked by human precept. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Therefore I will be to Ephraim like a moth, And to the house of Judah like rottenness. 

<sup>13</sup> 
"When Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah saw his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria And sent to King Jareb; Yet he cannot cure you, Nor heal you of your wound. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, And like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear them and go away; I will take them away, and no one shall rescue. 

<sup>15</sup> 
I will return again to My place Till they acknowledge their offense. Then they will seek My face; In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me."
