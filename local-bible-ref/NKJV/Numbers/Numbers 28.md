Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Command the children of Israel, and say to them, 'My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire as a sweet aroma to Me, you shall be careful to offer to Me at their appointed time.' 

<sup>3</sup> 
"And you shall say to them, 'This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the Lord: two male lambs in their first year without blemish, day by day, as a regular burnt offering. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, the other lamb you shall offer in the evening, 

<sup>5</sup> 
and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil. 

<sup>6</sup> 
It is a regular burnt offering which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And its drink offering shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb; in a holy place you shall pour out the drink to the Lord as an offering. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The other lamb you shall offer in the evening; as the morning grain offering and its drink offering, you shall offer it as an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord.

<sup>9</sup> 
'And on the Sabbath day two lambs in their first year, without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, with its drink offering-- 

<sup>10</sup> 
this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering.

<sup>11</sup> 
'At the beginnings of your months you shall present a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year, without blemish; 

<sup>12</sup> 
three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram; 

<sup>13</sup> 
and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with oil, as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of sweet aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Their drink offering shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb; this is the burnt offering for each month throughout the months of the year. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Also one kid of the goats as a sin offering to the Lord shall be offered, besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.

<sup>16</sup> 
'On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 

<sup>18</sup> 
On the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. 

<sup>19</sup> 
And you shall present an offering made by fire as a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year. Be sure they are without blemish. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah you shall offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram; 

<sup>21</sup> 
you shall offer one-tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs; 

<sup>22</sup> 
also one goat as a sin offering, to make atonement for you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a regular burnt offering. 

<sup>24</sup> 
In this manner you shall offer the food of the offering made by fire daily for seven days, as a sweet aroma to the Lord; it shall be offered besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>25</sup> 
And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work.

<sup>26</sup> 
'Also on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. 

<sup>27</sup> 
You shall present a burnt offering as a sweet aroma to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs in their first year, 

<sup>28</sup> 
with their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil: three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 

<sup>29</sup> 
and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs; 

<sup>30</sup> 
also one kid of the goats, to make atonement for you. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Be sure they are without blemish. You shall present them with their drink offerings, besides the regular burnt offering with its grain offering.
