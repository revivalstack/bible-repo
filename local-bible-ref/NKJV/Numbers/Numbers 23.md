<sup>1</sup> 
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams." 

<sup>2</sup> 
And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps the Lord will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me I will tell you." So he went to a desolate height. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram." 

<sup>5</sup> 
Then the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak." 

<sup>6</sup> 
So he returned to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, he and all the princes of Moab. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And he took up his oracle and said: "Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram, From the mountains of the east. 'Come, curse Jacob for me, And come, denounce Israel!' 

<sup>8</sup> 
"How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? And how shall I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced? 

<sup>9</sup> 
For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him; There! A people dwelling alone, Not reckoning itself among the nations. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number one-fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my end be like his!" 

<sup>11</sup> 
Then Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and look, you have blessed them bountifully!" 

<sup>12</sup> 
So he answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak what the Lord has put in my mouth?" 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place from which you may see them; you shall see only the outer part of them, and shall not see them all; curse them for me from there." 

<sup>14</sup> 
So he brought him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 

<sup>15</sup> 
And he said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering while I meet the Lord over there." 

<sup>16</sup> 
Then the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Go back to Balak, and thus you shall speak." 

<sup>17</sup> 
So he came to him, and there he was, standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, "What has the Lord spoken?" 

<sup>18</sup> 
Then he took up his oracle and said: "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, son of Zippor! 

<sup>19</sup> 
"God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Behold, I have received a command to bless; He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it. 

<sup>21</sup> 
"He has not observed iniquity in Jacob, Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, And the shout of a King is among them. 

<sup>22</sup> 
God brings them out of Egypt; He has strength like a wild ox. 

<sup>23</sup> 
"For there is no sorcery against Jacob, Nor any divination against Israel. It now must be said of Jacob And of Israel, 'Oh, what God has done!' 

<sup>24</sup> 
Look, a people rises like a lioness, And lifts itself up like a lion; It shall not lie down until it devours the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain." 

<sup>25</sup> 
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!" 

<sup>26</sup> 
So Balaam answered and said to Balak, "Did I not tell you, saying, 'All that the Lord speaks, that I must do'?" 

<sup>27</sup> 
Then Balak said to Balaam, "Please come, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there." 

<sup>28</sup> 
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Then Balaam said to Balak, "Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams." 

<sup>30</sup> 
And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.
