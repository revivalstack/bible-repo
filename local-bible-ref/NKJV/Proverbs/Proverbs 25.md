These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 

<sup>2</sup> 
It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. 

<sup>3</sup> 
As the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Take away the dross from silver, And it will go to the silversmith for jewelry. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne will be established in righteousness. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, And do not stand in the place of the great; 

<sup>7</sup> 
For it is better that he say to you, "Come up here," Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom your eyes have seen. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Do not go hastily to court; For what will you do in the end, When your neighbor has put you to shame? 

<sup>9</sup> 
Debate your case with your neighbor, And do not disclose the secret to another; 

<sup>10</sup> 
Lest he who hears it expose your shame, And your reputation be ruined. 

<sup>11</sup> 
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold In settings of silver. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold Is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Like the cold of snow in time of harvest Is a faithful messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the soul of his masters. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Whoever falsely boasts of giving Is like clouds and wind without rain. 

<sup>15</sup> 
By long forbearance a ruler is persuaded, And a gentle tongue breaks a bone. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Have you found honey? Eat only as much as you need, Lest you be filled with it and vomit. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house, Lest he become weary of you and hate you. 

<sup>18</sup> 
A man who bears false witness against his neighbor Is like a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a bad tooth and a foot out of joint. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Like one who takes away a garment in cold weather, And like vinegar on soda, Is one who sings songs to a heavy heart. 

<sup>21</sup> 
If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; 

<sup>22</sup> 
For so you will heap coals of fire on his head, And the Lord will reward you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The north wind brings forth rain, And a backbiting tongue an angry countenance. 

<sup>24</sup> 
It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop, Than in a house shared with a contentious woman. 

<sup>25</sup> 
As cold water to a weary soul, So is good news from a far country. 

<sup>26</sup> 
A righteous man who falters before the wicked Is like a murky spring and a polluted well. 

<sup>27</sup> 
It is not good to eat much honey; So to seek one's own glory is not glory. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Whoever has no rule over his own spirit Is like a city broken down, without walls.
