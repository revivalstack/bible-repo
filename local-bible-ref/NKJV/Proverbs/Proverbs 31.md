<sup>1</sup> 
The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him: 

<sup>2</sup> 
What, my son? And what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows? 

<sup>3</sup> 
Do not give your strength to women, Nor your ways to that which destroys kings. 

<sup>4</sup> 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, It is not for kings to drink wine, Nor for princes intoxicating drink; 

<sup>5</sup> 
Lest they drink and forget the law, And pervert the justice of all the afflicted. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Give strong drink to him who is perishing, And wine to those who are bitter of heart. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Let him drink and forget his poverty, And remember his misery no more. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Open your mouth for the speechless, In the cause of all who are appointed to die. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Open your mouth, judge righteously, And plead the cause of the poor and needy.

<sup>10</sup> 
Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain. 

<sup>12</sup> 
She does him good and not evil All the days of her life. 

<sup>13</sup> 
She seeks wool and flax, And willingly works with her hands. 

<sup>14</sup> 
She is like the merchant ships, She brings her food from afar. 

<sup>15</sup> 
She also rises while it is yet night, And provides food for her household, And a portion for her maidservants. 

<sup>16</sup> 
She considers a field and buys it; From her profits she plants a vineyard. 

<sup>17</sup> 
She girds herself with strength, And strengthens her arms. 

<sup>18</sup> 
She perceives that her merchandise is good, And her lamp does not go out by night. 

<sup>19</sup> 
She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hand holds the spindle. 

<sup>20</sup> 
She extends her hand to the poor, Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy. 

<sup>21</sup> 
She is not afraid of snow for her household, For all her household is clothed with scarlet. 

<sup>22</sup> 
She makes tapestry for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land. 

<sup>24</sup> 
She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies sashes for the merchants. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Strength and honor are her clothing; She shall rejoice in time to come. 

<sup>26</sup> 
She opens her mouth with wisdom, And on her tongue is the law of kindness. 

<sup>27</sup> 
She watches over the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praises her: 

<sup>29</sup> 
"Many daughters have done well, But you excel them all." 

<sup>30</sup> 
Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Give her of the fruit of her hands, And let her own works praise her in the gates.
