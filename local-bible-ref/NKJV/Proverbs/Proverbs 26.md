As snow in summer and rain in harvest, So honor is not fitting for a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Like a flitting sparrow, like a flying swallow, So a curse without cause shall not alight. 

<sup>3</sup> 
A whip for the horse, A bridle for the donkey, And a rod for the fool's back. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Do not answer a fool according to his folly, Lest you also be like him. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He who sends a message by the hand of a fool Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Like the legs of the lame that hang limp Is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Like one who binds a stone in a sling Is he who gives honor to a fool. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard Is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 

<sup>10</sup> 
The great God who formed everything Gives the fool his hire and the transgressor his wages. 

<sup>11</sup> 
As a dog returns to his own vomit, So a fool repeats his folly. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The lazy man says, "There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion is in the streets!" 

<sup>14</sup> 
As a door turns on its hinges, So does the lazy man on his bed. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The lazy man buries his hand in the bowl; It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
The lazy man is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can answer sensibly. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own Is like one who takes a dog by the ears. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death, 

<sup>19</sup> 
Is the man who deceives his neighbor, And says, "I was only joking!" 

<sup>20</sup> 
Where there is no wood, the fire goes out; And where there is no talebearer, strife ceases. 

<sup>21</sup> 
As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire, So is a contentious man to kindle strife. 

<sup>22</sup> 
The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles, And they go down into the inmost body. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Fervent lips with a wicked heart Are like earthenware covered with silver dross. 

<sup>24</sup> 
He who hates, disguises it with his lips, And lays up deceit within himself; 

<sup>25</sup> 
When he speaks kindly, do not believe him, For there are seven abominations in his heart; 

<sup>26</sup> 
Though his hatred is covered by deceit, His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, And he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him. 

<sup>28</sup> 
A lying tongue hates those who are crushed by it, And a flattering mouth works ruin.
