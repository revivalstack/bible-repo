<sup>1</sup> 
Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than one who is perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Also it is not good for a soul to be without knowledge, And he sins who hastens with his feet. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The foolishness of a man twists his way, And his heart frets against the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Wealth makes many friends, But the poor is separated from his friend. 

<sup>5</sup> 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who speaks lies will not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Many entreat the favor of the nobility, And every man is a friend to one who gives gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> 
All the brothers of the poor hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He may pursue them with words, yet they abandon him. 

<sup>8</sup> 
He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good. 

<sup>9</sup> 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who speaks lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Luxury is not fitting for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, And his glory is to overlook a transgression. 

<sup>12</sup> 
The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, But his favor is like dew on the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> 
A foolish son is the ruin of his father, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Houses and riches are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the Lord. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Laziness casts one into a deep sleep, And an idle person will suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> 
He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, But he who is careless of his ways will die. 

<sup>17</sup> 
He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, And He will pay back what he has given. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Chasten your son while there is hope, And do not set your heart on his destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> 
A man of great wrath will suffer punishment; For if you rescue him, you will have to do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Listen to counsel and receive instruction, That you may be wise in your latter days. 

<sup>21</sup> 
There are many plans in a man's heart, Nevertheless the Lord's counsel--that will stand. 

<sup>22</sup> 
What is desired in a man is kindness, And a poor man is better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The fear of the Lord leads to life, And he who has it will abide in satisfaction; He will not be visited with evil. 

<sup>24</sup> 
A lazy man buries his hand in the bowl, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Strike a scoffer, and the simple will become wary; Rebuke one who has understanding, and he will discern knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He who mistreats his father and chases away his mother Is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Cease listening to instruction, my son, And you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> 
A disreputable witness scorns justice, And the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And beatings for the backs of fools.
