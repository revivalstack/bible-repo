<sup>1</sup> 
My son, pay attention to my wisdom; Lend your ear to my understanding, 

<sup>2</sup> 
That you may preserve discretion, And your lips may keep knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil; 

<sup>4</sup> 
But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Her feet go down to death, Her steps lay hold of hell. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Lest you ponder her path of life-- Her ways are unstable; You do not know them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Therefore hear me now, my children, And do not depart from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Remove your way far from her, And do not go near the door of her house, 

<sup>9</sup> 
Lest you give your honor to others, And your years to the cruel one; 

<sup>10</sup> 
Lest aliens be filled with your wealth, And your labors go to the house of a foreigner; 

<sup>11</sup> 
And you mourn at last, When your flesh and your body are consumed, 

<sup>12</sup> 
And say: "How I have hated instruction, And my heart despised correction! 

<sup>13</sup> 
I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me! 

<sup>14</sup> 
I was on the verge of total ruin, In the midst of the assembly and congregation." 

<sup>15</sup> 
Drink water from your own cistern, And running water from your own well. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Should your fountains be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the streets? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Let them be only your own, And not for strangers with you. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice with the wife of your youth. 

<sup>19</sup> 
As a loving deer and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; And always be enraptured with her love. 

<sup>20</sup> 
For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman, And be embraced in the arms of a seductress? 

<sup>21</sup> 
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, And He ponders all his paths. 

<sup>22</sup> 
His own iniquities entrap the wicked man, And he is caught in the cords of his sin. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He shall die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
