When the wicked comes, contempt comes also; And with dishonor comes reproach. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is a flowing brook. 

<sup>5</sup> 
It is not good to show partiality to the wicked, Or to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

The poor man uses entreaties, But the rich answers roughly. 

<sup>24</sup> 
A man who has friends must himself be friendly, But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
