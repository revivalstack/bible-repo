<sup>1</sup> 
The preparations of the heart belong to man, But the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 
All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, But the Lord weighs the spirits. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Commit your works to the Lord, And your thoughts will be established. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The Lord has made all for Himself, Yes, even the wicked for the day of doom. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Everyone proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord; Though they join forces, none will go unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> 
In mercy and truth Atonement is provided for iniquity; And by the fear of the Lord one departs from evil. 

<sup>7</sup> 
When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Better is a little with righteousness, Than vast revenues without justice. 

<sup>9</sup> 
A man's heart plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Divination is on the lips of the king; His mouth must not transgress in judgment. 

<sup>11</sup> 
Honest weights and scales are the Lord's; All the weights in the bag are His work. 

<sup>12</sup> 
It is an abomination for kings to commit wickedness, For a throne is established by righteousness. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Righteous lips are the delight of kings, And they love him who speaks what is right. 

<sup>14</sup> 
As messengers of death is the king's wrath, But a wise man will appease it. 

<sup>15</sup> 
In the light of the king's face is life, And his favor is like a cloud of the latter rain. 

<sup>16</sup> 
How much better to get wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 

<sup>17</sup> 
The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; He who keeps his way preserves his soul. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, Than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

<sup>20</sup> 
He who heeds the word wisely will find good, And whoever trusts in the Lord, happy is he. 

<sup>21</sup> 
The wise in heart will be called prudent, And sweetness of the lips increases learning. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Understanding is a wellspring of life to him who has it. But the correction of fools is folly. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, And adds learning to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, Sweetness to the soul and health to the bones. 

<sup>25</sup> 
There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death. 

<sup>26</sup> 
The person who labors, labors for himself, For his hungry mouth drives him on. 

<sup>27</sup> 
An ungodly man digs up evil, And it is on his lips like a burning fire. 

<sup>28</sup> 
A perverse man sows strife, And a whisperer separates the best of friends. 

<sup>29</sup> 
A violent man entices his neighbor, And leads him in a way that is not good. 

<sup>30</sup> 
He winks his eye to devise perverse things; He purses his lips and brings about evil. 

<sup>31</sup> 
The silver-haired head is a crown of glory, If it is found in the way of righteousness. 

<sup>32</sup> 
He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city. 

<sup>33</sup> 
The lot is cast into the lap, But its every decision is from the Lord.
