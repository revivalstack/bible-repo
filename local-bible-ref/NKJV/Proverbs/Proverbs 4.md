<sup>1</sup> 
Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding; 

<sup>2</sup> 
For I give you good doctrine: Do not forsake my law. 

<sup>3</sup> 
When I was my father's son, Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother, 

<sup>4</sup> 
He also taught me, and said to me: "Let your heart retain my words; Keep my commands, and live. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you; Love her, and she will keep you. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Wisdom is the principal thing; Therefore get wisdom. And in all your getting, get understanding. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Exalt her, and she will promote you; She will bring you honor, when you embrace her. 

<sup>9</sup> 
She will place on your head an ornament of grace; A crown of glory she will deliver to you." 

<sup>10</sup> 
Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And the years of your life will be many. 

<sup>11</sup> 
I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in right paths. 

<sup>12</sup> 
When you walk, your steps will not be hindered, And when you run, you will not stumble. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; Keep her, for she is your life. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Do not enter the path of the wicked, And do not walk in the way of evil. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Avoid it, do not travel on it; Turn away from it and pass on. 

<sup>16</sup> 
For they do not sleep unless they have done evil; And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence. 

<sup>18</sup> 
But the path of the just is like the shining sun, That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The way of the wicked is like darkness; They do not know what makes them stumble. 

<sup>20</sup> 
My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; 

<sup>22</sup> 
For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Keep your heart with all diligence, For out of it spring the issues of life. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Put away from you a deceitful mouth, And put perverse lips far from you. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Let your eyes look straight ahead, And your eyelids look right before you. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Ponder the path of your feet, And let all your ways be established. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Do not turn to the right or the left; Remove your foot from evil.
