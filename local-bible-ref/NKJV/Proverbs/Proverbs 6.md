<sup>1</sup> 
My son, if you become surety for your friend, If you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger, 

<sup>2</sup> 
You are snared by the words of your mouth; You are taken by the words of your mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> 
So do this, my son, and deliver yourself; For you have come into the hand of your friend: Go and humble yourself; Plead with your friend. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Give no sleep to your eyes, Nor slumber to your eyelids. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

<sup>6</sup> 
Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise, 

<sup>7</sup> 
Which, having no captain, Overseer or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Provides her supplies in the summer, And gathers her food in the harvest. 

<sup>9</sup> 
How long will you slumber, O sluggard? When will you rise from your sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> 
A little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep-- 

<sup>11</sup> 
So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler, And your need like an armed man.

<sup>12</sup> 
A worthless person, a wicked man, Walks with a perverse mouth; 

<sup>13</sup> 
He winks with his eyes, He shuffles his feet, He points with his fingers; 

<sup>14</sup> 
Perversity is in his heart, He devises evil continually, He sows discord. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy. 

<sup>16</sup> 
These six things the Lord hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: 

<sup>17</sup> 
A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, 

<sup>18</sup> 
A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, 

<sup>19</sup> 
A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren.

<sup>20</sup> 
My son, keep your father's command, And do not forsake the law of your mother. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Bind them continually upon your heart; Tie them around your neck. 

<sup>22</sup> 
When you roam, they will lead you; When you sleep, they will keep you; And when you awake, they will speak with you. 

<sup>23</sup> 
For the commandment is a lamp, And the law a light; Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, 

<sup>24</sup> 
To keep you from the evil woman, From the flattering tongue of a seductress. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Do not lust after her beauty in your heart, Nor let her allure you with her eyelids. 

<sup>26</sup> 
For by means of a harlot A man is reduced to a crust of bread; And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Can a man take fire to his bosom, And his clothes not be burned? 

<sup>28</sup> 
Can one walk on hot coals, And his feet not be seared? 

<sup>29</sup> 
So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; Whoever touches her shall not be innocent. 

<sup>30</sup> 
People do not despise a thief If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold; He may have to give up all the substance of his house. 

<sup>32</sup> 
Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding; He who does so destroys his own soul. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Wounds and dishonor he will get, And his reproach will not be wiped away. 

<sup>34</sup> 
For jealousy is a husband's fury; Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

<sup>35</sup> 
He will accept no recompense, Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.
