<sup>1</sup> 
My son, do not forget my law, But let your heart keep my commands; 

<sup>2</sup> 
For length of days and long life And peace they will add to you. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Let not mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart, 

<sup>4</sup> 
And so find favor and high esteem In the sight of God and man. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 

<sup>6</sup> 
In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord and depart from evil. 

<sup>8</sup> 
It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Honor the Lord with your possessions, And with the firstfruits of all your increase; 

<sup>10</sup> 
So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine. 

<sup>11</sup> 
My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor detest His correction; 

<sup>12</sup> 
For whom the Lord loves He corrects, Just as a father the son in whom he delights. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Happy is the man who finds wisdom, And the man who gains understanding; 

<sup>14</sup> 
For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver, And her gain than fine gold. 

<sup>15</sup> 
She is more precious than rubies, And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Length of days is in her right hand, In her left hand riches and honor. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace. 

<sup>18</sup> 
She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy are all who retain her. 

<sup>19</sup> 
The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding He established the heavens; 

<sup>20</sup> 
By His knowledge the depths were broken up, And clouds drop down the dew. 

<sup>21</sup> 
My son, let them not depart from your eyes-- Keep sound wisdom and discretion; 

<sup>22</sup> 
So they will be life to your soul And grace to your neck. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Then you will walk safely in your way, And your foot will not stumble. 

<sup>24</sup> 
When you lie down, you will not be afraid; Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Do not be afraid of sudden terror, Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes; 

<sup>26</sup> 
For the Lord will be your confidence, And will keep your foot from being caught. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, When it is in the power of your hand to do so. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back, And tomorrow I will give it," When you have it with you. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Do not devise evil against your neighbor, For he dwells by you for safety's sake. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Do not strive with a man without cause, If he has done you no harm. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Do not envy the oppressor, And choose none of his ways; 

<sup>32</sup> 
For the perverse person is an abomination to the Lord, But His secret counsel is with the upright. 

<sup>33</sup> 
The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked, But He blesses the home of the just. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Surely He scorns the scornful, But gives grace to the humble. 

<sup>35</sup> 
The wise shall inherit glory, But shame shall be the legacy of fools.
