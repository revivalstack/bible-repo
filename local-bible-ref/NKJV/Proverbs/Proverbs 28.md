The wicked flee when no one pursues, But the righteous are bold as a lion. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Because of the transgression of a land, many are its princes; But by a man of understanding and knowledge Right will be prolonged. 

<sup>3</sup> 
A poor man who oppresses the poor Is like a driving rain which leaves no food. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, But such as keep the law contend with them. 

<sup>5</sup> 
Evil men do not understand justice, But those who seek the Lord understand all. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than one perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Whoever keeps the law is a discerning son, But a companion of gluttons shames his father. 

<sup>8</sup> 
One who increases his possessions by usury and extortion Gathers it for him who will pity the poor. 

<sup>9</sup> 
One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, He himself will fall into his own pit; But the blameless will inherit good. 

<sup>11</sup> 
The rich man is wise in his own eyes, But the poor who has understanding searches him out. 

<sup>12</sup> 
When the righteous rejoice, there is great glory; But when the wicked arise, men hide themselves. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He who covers his sins will not prosper, But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Happy is the man who is always reverent, But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Like a roaring lion and a charging bear Is a wicked ruler over poor people. 

<sup>16</sup> 
A ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor, But he who hates covetousness will prolong his days. 

<sup>17</sup> 
A man burdened with bloodshed will flee into a pit; Let no one help him. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved, But he who is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall. 

<sup>19</sup> 
He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough! 

<sup>20</sup> 
A faithful man will abound with blessings, But he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. 

<sup>21</sup> 
To show partiality is not good, Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. 

<sup>22</sup> 
A man with an evil eye hastens after riches, And does not consider that poverty will come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> 
He who rebukes a man will find more favor afterward Than he who flatters with the tongue. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Whoever robs his father or his mother, And says, "It is no transgression," The same is companion to a destroyer. 

<sup>25</sup> 
He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife, But he who trusts in the Lord will be prospered. 

<sup>26</sup> 
He who trusts in his own heart is a fool, But whoever walks wisely will be delivered. 

<sup>27</sup> 
He who gives to the poor will not lack, But he who hides his eyes will have many curses. 

<sup>28</sup> 
When the wicked arise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.
