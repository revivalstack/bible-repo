Wisdom has built her house, She has hewn out her seven pillars; 

<sup>2</sup> 
She has slaughtered her meat, She has mixed her wine, She has also furnished her table. 

<sup>3</sup> 
She has sent out her maidens, She cries out from the highest places of the city, 

<sup>4</sup> 
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Come, eat of my bread And drink of the wine I have mixed. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Forsake foolishness and live, And go in the way of understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> 
"He who corrects a scoffer gets shame for himself, And he who rebukes a wicked man only harms himself. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you; Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. 

<sup>10</sup> 
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> 
For by me your days will be multiplied, And years of life will be added to you. 

<sup>12</sup> 
If you are wise, you are wise for yourself, And if you scoff, you will bear it alone." 

<sup>13</sup> 
A foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knows nothing. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For she sits at the door of her house, On a seat by the highest places of the city, 

<sup>15</sup> 
To call to those who pass by, Who go straight on their way: 

<sup>16</sup> 
"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here"; And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 

<sup>17</sup> 
"Stolen water is sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant." 

<sup>18</sup> 
But he does not know that the dead are there, That her guests are in the depths of hell.
