My son, if you receive my words, And treasure my commands within you, 

<sup>2</sup> 
So that you incline your ear to wisdom, And apply your heart to understanding; 

<sup>3</sup> 
Yes, if you cry out for discernment, And lift up your voice for understanding, 

<sup>4</sup> 
If you seek her as silver, And search for her as for hidden treasures; 

<sup>5</sup> 
Then you will understand the fear of the Lord, And find the knowledge of God. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For the Lord gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; 

<sup>7</sup> 
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk uprightly; 

<sup>8</sup> 
He guards the paths of justice, And preserves the way of His saints. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Then you will understand righteousness and justice, Equity and every good path. 

<sup>10</sup> 
When wisdom enters your heart, And knowledge is pleasant to your soul, 

<sup>11</sup> 
Discretion will preserve you; Understanding will keep you, 

<sup>12</sup> 
To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse things, 

<sup>13</sup> 
From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of darkness; 

<sup>14</sup> 
Who rejoice in doing evil, And delight in the perversity of the wicked; 

<sup>15</sup> 
Whose ways are crooked, And who are devious in their paths; 

<sup>16</sup> 
To deliver you from the immoral woman, From the seductress who flatters with her words, 

<sup>17</sup> 
Who forsakes the companion of her youth, And forgets the covenant of her God. 

<sup>18</sup> 
For her house leads down to death, And her paths to the dead; 

<sup>19</sup> 
None who go to her return, Nor do they regain the paths of life-- 

<sup>20</sup> 
So you may walk in the way of goodness, And keep to the paths of righteousness. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For the upright will dwell in the land, And the blameless will remain in it; 

<sup>22</sup> 
But the wicked will be cut off from the earth, And the unfaithful will be uprooted from it.
