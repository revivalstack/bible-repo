The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> 
To know wisdom and instruction, To perceive the words of understanding, 

<sup>3</sup> 
To receive the instruction of wisdom, Justice, judgment, and equity; 

<sup>4</sup> 
To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion-- 

<sup>5</sup> 
A wise man will hear and increase learning, And a man of understanding will attain wise counsel, 

<sup>6</sup> 
To understand a proverb and an enigma, The words of the wise and their riddles. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, But fools despise wisdom and instruction.

<sup>8</sup> 
My son, hear the instruction of your father, And do not forsake the law of your mother; 

<sup>9</sup> 
For they will be a graceful ornament on your head, And chains about your neck. 

<sup>10</sup> 
My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. 

<sup>11</sup> 
If they say, "Come with us, Let us lie in wait to shed blood; Let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause; 

<sup>12</sup> 
Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, And whole, like those who go down to the Pit; 

<sup>13</sup> 
We shall find all kinds of precious possessions, We shall fill our houses with spoil; 

<sup>14</sup> 
Cast in your lot among us, Let us all have one purse"-- 

<sup>15</sup> 
My son, do not walk in the way with them, Keep your foot from their path; 

<sup>16</sup> 
For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Surely, in vain the net is spread In the sight of any bird; 

<sup>18</sup> 
But they lie in wait for their own blood, They lurk secretly for their own lives. 

<sup>19</sup> 
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain; It takes away the life of its owners.

<sup>20</sup> 
Wisdom calls aloud outside; She raises her voice in the open squares. 

<sup>21</sup> 
She cries out in the chief concourses, At the openings of the gates in the city She speaks her words: 

<sup>22</sup> 
"How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? For scorners delight in their scorning, And fools hate knowledge. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Turn at my rebuke; Surely I will pour out my spirit on you; I will make my words known to you. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one regarded, 

<sup>25</sup> 
Because you disdained all my counsel, And would have none of my rebuke, 

<sup>26</sup> 
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your terror comes, 

<sup>27</sup> 
When your terror comes like a storm, And your destruction comes like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you. 

<sup>28</sup> 
"Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of the Lord, 

<sup>30</sup> 
They would have none of my counsel And despised my every rebuke. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, And be filled to the full with their own fancies. 

<sup>32</sup> 
For the turning away of the simple will slay them, And the complacency of fools will destroy them; 

<sup>33</sup> 
But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure, without fear of evil."
