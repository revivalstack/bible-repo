<sup>1</sup> 
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, his utterance. This man declared to Ithiel--to Ithiel and Ucal: 

<sup>2</sup> 
Surely I am more stupid than any man, And do not have the understanding of a man. 

<sup>3</sup> 
I neither learned wisdom Nor have knowledge of the Holy One. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Who has ascended into heaven, or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son's name, If you know? 

<sup>5</sup> 
Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Two things I request of You (Deprive me not before I die): 

<sup>8</sup> 
Remove falsehood and lies far from me; Give me neither poverty nor riches-- Feed me with the food allotted to me; 

<sup>9</sup> 
Lest I be full and deny You, And say, "Who is the Lord?" Or lest I be poor and steal, And profane the name of my God. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Do not malign a servant to his master, Lest he curse you, and you be found guilty. 

<sup>11</sup> 
There is a generation that curses its father, And does not bless its mother. 

<sup>12</sup> 
There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, Yet is not washed from its filthiness. 

<sup>13</sup> 
There is a generation--oh, how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up. 

<sup>14</sup> 
There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, And whose fangs are like knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, And the needy from among men. 

<sup>15</sup> 
The leech has two daughters-- Give and Give! There are three things that are never satisfied, Four never say, "Enough!": 

<sup>16</sup> 
The grave, The barren womb, The earth that is not satisfied with water-- And the fire never says, "Enough!" 

<sup>17</sup> 
The eye that mocks his father, And scorns obedience to his mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it. 

<sup>18</sup> 
There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yes, four which I do not understand: 

<sup>19</sup> 
The way of an eagle in the air, The way of a serpent on a rock, The way of a ship in the midst of the sea, And the way of a man with a virgin. 

<sup>20</sup> 
This is the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, And says, "I have done no wickedness." 

<sup>21</sup> 
For three things the earth is perturbed, Yes, for four it cannot bear up: 

<sup>22</sup> 
For a servant when he reigns, A fool when he is filled with food, 

<sup>23</sup> 
A hateful woman when she is married, And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress. 

<sup>24</sup> 
There are four things which are little on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise: 

<sup>25</sup> 
The ants are a people not strong, Yet they prepare their food in the summer; 

<sup>26</sup> 
The rock badgers are a feeble folk, Yet they make their homes in the crags; 

<sup>27</sup> 
The locusts have no king, Yet they all advance in ranks; 

<sup>28</sup> 
The spider skillfully grasps with its hands, And it is in kings' palaces. 

<sup>29</sup> 
There are three things which are majestic in pace, Yes, four which are stately in walk: 

<sup>30</sup> 
A lion, which is mighty among beasts And does not turn away from any; 

<sup>31</sup> 
A greyhound, A male goat also, And a king whose troops are with him. 

<sup>32</sup> 
If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, Or if you have devised evil, put your hand on your mouth. 

<sup>33</sup> 
For as the churning of milk produces butter, And wringing the nose produces blood, So the forcing of wrath produces strife.
