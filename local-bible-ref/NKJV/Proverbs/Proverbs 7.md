<sup>1</sup> 
My son, keep my words, And treasure my commands within you. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Keep my commands and live, And my law as the apple of your eye. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," And call understanding your nearest kin, 

<sup>5</sup> 
That they may keep you from the immoral woman, From the seductress who flatters with her words.

<sup>6</sup> 
For at the window of my house I looked through my lattice, 

<sup>7</sup> 
And saw among the simple, I perceived among the youths, A young man devoid of understanding, 

<sup>8</sup> 
Passing along the street near her corner; And he took the path to her house 

<sup>9</sup> 
In the twilight, in the evening, In the black and dark night. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And there a woman met him, With the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 
She was loud and rebellious, Her feet would not stay at home. 

<sup>12</sup> 
At times she was outside, at times in the open square, Lurking at every corner. 

<sup>13</sup> 
So she caught him and kissed him; With an impudent face she said to him: 

<sup>14</sup> 
"I have peace offerings with me; Today I have paid my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> 
So I came out to meet you, Diligently to seek your face, And I have found you. 

<sup>16</sup> 
I have spread my bed with tapestry, Colored coverings of Egyptian linen. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with love. 

<sup>19</sup> 
For my husband is not at home; He has gone on a long journey; 

<sup>20</sup> 
He has taken a bag of money with him, And will come home on the appointed day." 

<sup>21</sup> 
With her enticing speech she caused him to yield, With her flattering lips she seduced him. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks, 

<sup>23</sup> 
Till an arrow struck his liver. As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know it would cost his life. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Now therefore, listen to me, my children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth: 

<sup>25</sup> 
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths; 

<sup>26</sup> 
For she has cast down many wounded, And all who were slain by her were strong men. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Her house is the way to hell, Descending to the chambers of death.
