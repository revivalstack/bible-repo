<sup>1</sup> 
When you sit down to eat with a ruler, Consider carefully what is before you; 

<sup>2</sup> 
And put a knife to your throat If you are a man given to appetite. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Do not desire his delicacies, For they are deceptive food. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Do not overwork to be rich; Because of your own understanding, cease! 

<sup>5</sup> 
Will you set your eyes on that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings; They fly away like an eagle toward heaven. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Do not eat the bread of a miser, Nor desire his delicacies; 

<sup>7</sup> 
For as he thinks in his heart, so is he. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, But his heart is not with you. 

<sup>8</sup> 
The morsel you have eaten, you will vomit up, And waste your pleasant words. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, For he will despise the wisdom of your words. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Do not remove the ancient landmark, Nor enter the fields of the fatherless; 

<sup>11</sup> 
For their Redeemer is mighty; He will plead their cause against you. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Apply your heart to instruction, And your ears to words of knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Do not withhold correction from a child, For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. 

<sup>14</sup> 
You shall beat him with a rod, And deliver his soul from hell. 

<sup>15</sup> 
My son, if your heart is wise, My heart will rejoice--indeed, I myself; 

<sup>16</sup> 
Yes, my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak right things. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Do not let your heart envy sinners, But be zealous for the fear of the Lord all the day; 

<sup>18</sup> 
For surely there is a hereafter, And your hope will not be cut off. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Hear, my son, and be wise; And guide your heart in the way. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Do not mix with winebibbers, Or with gluttonous eaters of meat; 

<sup>21</sup> 
For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Listen to your father who begot you, And do not despise your mother when she is old. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Buy the truth, and do not sell it, Also wisdom and instruction and understanding. 

<sup>24</sup> 
The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who begets a wise child will delight in him. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Let your father and your mother be glad, And let her who bore you rejoice. 

<sup>26</sup> 
My son, give me your heart, And let your eyes observe my ways. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For a harlot is a deep pit, And a seductress is a narrow well. 

<sup>28</sup> 
She also lies in wait as for a victim, And increases the unfaithful among men. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? 

<sup>30</sup> 
Those who linger long at the wine, Those who go in search of mixed wine. 

<sup>31</sup> 
Do not look on the wine when it is red, When it sparkles in the cup, When it swirls around smoothly; 

<sup>32</sup> 
At the last it bites like a serpent, And stings like a viper. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Your eyes will see strange things, And your heart will utter perverse things. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, Or like one who lies at the top of the mast, saying: 

<sup>35</sup> 
"They have struck me, but I was not hurt; They have beaten me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake, that I may seek another drink?"
