<sup>1</sup> 
Does not wisdom cry out, And understanding lift up her voice? 

<sup>2</sup> 
She takes her stand on the top of the high hill, Beside the way, where the paths meet. 

<sup>3</sup> 
She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city, At the entrance of the doors: 

<sup>4</sup> 
"To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> 
O you simple ones, understand prudence, And you fools, be of an understanding heart. 

<sup>6</sup> 
Listen, for I will speak of excellent things, And from the opening of my lips will come right things; 

<sup>7</sup> 
For my mouth will speak truth; Wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> 
All the words of my mouth are with righteousness; Nothing crooked or perverse is in them. 

<sup>9</sup> 
They are all plain to him who understands, And right to those who find knowledge. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold; 

<sup>11</sup> 
For wisdom is better than rubies, And all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge and discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> 
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, I have strength. 

<sup>15</sup> 
By me kings reign, And rulers decree justice. 

<sup>16</sup> 
By me princes rule, and nobles, All the judges of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> 
I love those who love me, And those who seek me diligently will find me. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Riches and honor are with me, Enduring riches and righteousness. 

<sup>19</sup> 
My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold, And my revenue than choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> 
I traverse the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice, 

<sup>21</sup> 
That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, That I may fill their treasuries. 

<sup>22</sup> 
"The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way, Before His works of old. 

<sup>23</sup> 
I have been established from everlasting, From the beginning, before there was ever an earth. 

<sup>24</sup> 
When there were no depths I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills, I was brought forth; 

<sup>26</sup> 
While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields, Or the primal dust of the world. 

<sup>27</sup> 
When He prepared the heavens, I was there, When He drew a circle on the face of the deep, 

<sup>28</sup> 
When He established the clouds above, When He strengthened the fountains of the deep, 

<sup>29</sup> 
When He assigned to the sea its limit, So that the waters would not transgress His command, When He marked out the foundations of the earth, 

<sup>30</sup> 
Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman; And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him, 

<sup>31</sup> 
Rejoicing in His inhabited world, And my delight was with the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> 
"Now therefore, listen to me, my children, For blessed are those who keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> 
Hear instruction and be wise, And do not disdain it. 

<sup>34</sup> 
Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors. 

<sup>35</sup> 
For whoever finds me finds life, And obtains favor from the Lord; 

<sup>36</sup> 
But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul; All those who hate me love death."
