<sup>1</sup> 
Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it. 

<sup>3</sup> 
His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men. 

<sup>5</sup> 
But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 

<sup>6</sup> 
He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you." 

<sup>8</sup> 
So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.

<sup>9</sup> 
And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me." 

<sup>11</sup> 
Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened. 

<sup>12</sup> 
When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 

<sup>13</sup> 
saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept.' 

<sup>14</sup> 
And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and make you secure." 

<sup>15</sup> 
So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.

<sup>16</sup> 
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. 

<sup>17</sup> 
When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted. 

<sup>18</sup> 
And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

<sup>20</sup> 
teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen.
