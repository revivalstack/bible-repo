<sup>1</sup> 
And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: 

<sup>2</sup> 
"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, 

<sup>3</sup> 
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Again, he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding." ' 

<sup>5</sup> 
But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.' 

<sup>10</sup> 
So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests. 

<sup>11</sup> 
"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment. 

<sup>12</sup> 
So he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' 

<sup>14</sup> 
"For many are called, but few are chosen." 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His talk. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men. 

<sup>17</sup> 
Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?" 

<sup>18</sup> 
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, "Why do you test Me, you hypocrites? 

<sup>19</sup> 
Show Me the tax money." So they brought Him a denarius. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?" 

<sup>21</sup> 
They said to Him, "Caesar's." And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 

<sup>22</sup> 
When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way.

<sup>23</sup> 
The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him, 

<sup>24</sup> 
saying: "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh. 

<sup>27</sup> 
Last of all the woman died also. 

<sup>28</sup> 
Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her." 

<sup>29</sup> 
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. 

<sup>30</sup> 
For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven. 

<sup>31</sup> 
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying, 

<sup>32</sup> 
'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." 

<sup>33</sup> 
And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.

<sup>34</sup> 
But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. 

<sup>35</sup> 
Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, 

<sup>36</sup> 
"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" 

<sup>37</sup> 
Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.' 

<sup>38</sup> 
This is the first and great commandment. 

<sup>39</sup> 
And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 

<sup>40</sup> 
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." 

<sup>41</sup> 
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 

<sup>42</sup> 
saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?" They said to Him, "The Son of David." 

<sup>43</sup> 
He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying: 

<sup>44</sup> 
'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool" '? 

<sup>45</sup> 
If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his Son?" 

<sup>46</sup> 
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore.
