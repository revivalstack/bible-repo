<sup>1</sup> 
Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 
"Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread." 

<sup>3</sup> 
He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 

<sup>4</sup> 
For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.' 

<sup>5</sup> 
But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God"-- 

<sup>6</sup> 
then he need not honor his father or mother.' Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 

<sup>8</sup> 
'These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And in vain they worship Me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' " 

<sup>10</sup> 
When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, "Hear and understand: 

<sup>11</sup> 
Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man." 

<sup>12</sup> 
Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?" 

<sup>13</sup> 
But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch." 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain this parable to us." 

<sup>16</sup> 
So Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding? 

<sup>17</sup> 
Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? 

<sup>18</sup> 
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. 

<sup>19</sup> 
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. 

<sup>20</sup> 
These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man." 

<sup>21</sup> 
Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed." 

<sup>23</sup> 
But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us." 

<sup>24</sup> 
But He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." 

<sup>25</sup> 
Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!" 

<sup>26</sup> 
But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs." 

<sup>27</sup> 
And she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table." 

<sup>28</sup> 
Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

<sup>29</sup> 
Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there. 

<sup>30</sup> 
Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them. 

<sup>31</sup> 
So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.

<sup>32</sup> 
Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way." 

<sup>33</sup> 
Then His disciples said to Him, "Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?" 

<sup>34</sup> 
Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?" And they said, "Seven, and a few little fish." 

<sup>35</sup> 
So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 

<sup>36</sup> 
And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude. 

<sup>37</sup> 
So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. 

<sup>38</sup> 
Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 

<sup>39</sup> 
And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.
