<sup>1</sup> 
Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?" He answered and said to him, "It is as you say." 

<sup>3</sup> 
And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!" 

<sup>5</sup> 
But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.

<sup>6</sup> 
Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested. 

<sup>7</sup> 
And there was one named Barabbas, who was chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them. 

<sup>9</sup> 
But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" 

<sup>10</sup> 
For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?" 

<sup>13</sup> 
So they cried out again, "Crucify Him!" 

<sup>14</sup> 
Then Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!" 

<sup>15</sup> 
So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified.

<sup>16</sup> 
Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head, 

<sup>18</sup> 
and began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 

<sup>19</sup> 
Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him. 

<sup>20</sup> 
And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.

<sup>21</sup> 
Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 

<sup>23</sup> 
Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it. 

<sup>24</sup> 
And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take. 

<sup>25</sup> 
Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. 

<sup>26</sup> 
And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS. 

<sup>27</sup> 
With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. 

<sup>28</sup> 
So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors." 

<sup>29</sup> 
And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, 

<sup>30</sup> 
save Yourself, and come down from the cross!" 

<sup>31</sup> 
Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, "He saved others; Himself He cannot save. 

<sup>32</sup> 
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.

<sup>33</sup> 
Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

<sup>34</sup> 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" 

<sup>35</sup> 
Some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, "Look, He is calling for Elijah!" 

<sup>36</sup> 
Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, "Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down." 

<sup>37</sup> 
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last. 

<sup>38</sup> 
Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 

<sup>39</sup> 
So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!" 

<sup>40</sup> 
There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, 

<sup>41</sup> 
who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.

<sup>42</sup> 
Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 

<sup>43</sup> 
Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 

<sup>44</sup> 
Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. 

<sup>45</sup> 
So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 

<sup>46</sup> 
Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 

<sup>47</sup> 
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.
