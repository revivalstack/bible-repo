You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 

<sup>3</sup> 
You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>4</sup> 
No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel, 

<sup>9</sup> 
for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

<sup>11</sup> 
This is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, We shall also live with Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 
If we endure, We shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us. 

<sup>13</sup> 
If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.

<sup>14</sup> 
Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers. 

<sup>15</sup> 
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 

<sup>16</sup> 
But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness. 

<sup>17</sup> 
And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort, 

<sup>18</sup> 
who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity." 

<sup>20</sup> 
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. 

<sup>21</sup> 
Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 

<sup>23</sup> 
But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 

<sup>24</sup> 
And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, 

<sup>25</sup> 
in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, 

<sup>26</sup> 
and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.
