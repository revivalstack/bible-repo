But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 

<sup>2</sup> 
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

<sup>3</sup> 
unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 

<sup>4</sup> 
traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 

<sup>5</sup> 
having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! 

<sup>6</sup> 
For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 

<sup>7</sup> 
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; 

<sup>9</sup> 
but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.

<sup>10</sup> 
But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 

<sup>11</sup> 
persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra--what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 

<sup>13</sup> 
But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 

<sup>15</sup> 
and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>16</sup> 
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 

<sup>17</sup> 
that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.
