<sup>1</sup> 
Now it came to pass when the king was dwelling in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies all around, 

<sup>2</sup> 
that the king said to Nathan the prophet, "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells inside tent curtains." 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then Nathan said to the king, "Go, do all that is in your heart, for the Lord is with you." 

<sup>4</sup> 
But it happened that night that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, 

<sup>5</sup> 
"Go and tell My servant David, 'Thus says the Lord: "Would you build a house for Me to dwell in? 

<sup>6</sup> 
For I have not dwelt in a house since the time that I brought the children of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day, but have moved about in a tent and in a tabernacle. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Wherever I have moved about with all the children of Israel, have I ever spoken a word to anyone from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, 'Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?' " ' 

<sup>8</sup> 
Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts: "I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people, over Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you, and have made you a great name, like the name of the great men who are on the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, 

<sup>11</sup> 
since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the Lord tells you that He will make you a house. 

<sup>12</sup> 
"When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. 

<sup>13</sup> 
He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 

<sup>14</sup> 
I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But My mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 

<sup>16</sup> 
And your house and your kingdom shall be established forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever." ' " 

<sup>17</sup> 
According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

<sup>18</sup> 
Then King David went in and sat before the Lord; and he said: "Who am I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that You have brought me this far? 

<sup>19</sup> 
And yet this was a small thing in Your sight, O Lord God; and You have also spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come. Is this the manner of man, O Lord God? 

<sup>20</sup> 
Now what more can David say to You? For You, Lord God, know Your servant. 

<sup>21</sup> 
For Your word's sake, and according to Your own heart, You have done all these great things, to make Your servant know them. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Therefore You are great, O Lord God. For there is none like You, nor is there any God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 

<sup>23</sup> 
And who is like Your people, like Israel, the one nation on the earth whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people, to make for Himself a name--and to do for Yourself great and awesome deeds for Your land--before Your people whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, the nations, and their gods? 

<sup>24</sup> 
For You have made Your people Israel Your very own people forever; and You, Lord, have become their God. 

<sup>25</sup> 
"Now, O Lord God, the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and concerning his house, establish it forever and do as You have said. 

<sup>26</sup> 
So let Your name be magnified forever, saying, 'The Lord of hosts is the God over Israel.' And let the house of Your servant David be established before You. 

<sup>27</sup> 
For You, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house.' Therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray this prayer to You. 

<sup>28</sup> 
"And now, O Lord God, You are God, and Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Now therefore, let it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for You, O Lord God, have spoken it, and with Your blessing let the house of Your servant be blessed forever."
