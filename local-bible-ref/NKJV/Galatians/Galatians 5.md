<sup>1</sup> 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 

<sup>3</sup> 
And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. 

<sup>4</sup> 
You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 

<sup>6</sup> 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.

<sup>7</sup> 
You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? 

<sup>8</sup> 
This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you. 

<sup>9</sup> 
A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 

<sup>10</sup> 
I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is. 

<sup>11</sup> 
And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. 

<sup>12</sup> 
I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off! 

<sup>13</sup> 
For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 

<sup>14</sup> 
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

<sup>15</sup> 
But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! 

<sup>16</sup> 
I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 

<sup>17</sup> 
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 

<sup>18</sup> 
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 

<sup>19</sup> 
Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 

<sup>20</sup> 
idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 

<sup>21</sup> 
envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 

<sup>22</sup> 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 

<sup>23</sup> 
gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 

<sup>24</sup> 
And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 

<sup>25</sup> 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
