Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), 

<sup>2</sup> 
and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: 

<sup>3</sup> 
Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 

<sup>4</sup> 
who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 

<sup>5</sup> 
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

<sup>6</sup> 
I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 

<sup>7</sup> 
which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 

<sup>8</sup> 
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 

<sup>9</sup> 
As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed. 

<sup>10</sup> 
For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.

<sup>11</sup> 
But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 

<sup>12</sup> 
For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it. 

<sup>14</sup> 
And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 

<sup>15</sup> 
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace, 

<sup>16</sup> 
to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, 

<sup>17</sup> 
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.

<sup>18</sup> 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. 

<sup>19</sup> 
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother. 

<sup>20</sup> 
(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.) 

<sup>21</sup> 
Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

<sup>22</sup> 
And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. 

<sup>23</sup> 
But they were hearing only, "He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy." 

<sup>24</sup> 
And they glorified God in me.
