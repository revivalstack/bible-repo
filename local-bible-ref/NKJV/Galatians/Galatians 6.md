Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. 

<sup>2</sup> 
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 

<sup>3</sup> 
For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 

<sup>4</sup> 
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 

<sup>5</sup> 
For each one shall bear his own load.

<sup>6</sup> 
Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 

<sup>8</sup> 
For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. 

<sup>9</sup> 
And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. 

<sup>10</sup> 
Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.

<sup>11</sup> 
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 

<sup>12</sup> 
As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 

<sup>13</sup> 
For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 

<sup>14</sup> 
But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 

<sup>15</sup> 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.

<sup>16</sup> 
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 

<sup>17</sup> 
From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
