<sup>1</sup> 
Now this is the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood. 

<sup>2</sup> 
The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 

<sup>3</sup> 
The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 

<sup>4</sup> 
The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

<sup>5</sup> 
From these the coastland peoples of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. 

<sup>6</sup> 
The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 

<sup>7</sup> 
The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan. 

<sup>8</sup> 
Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> 
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, "Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord." 

<sup>10</sup> 
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

<sup>11</sup> 
From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 

<sup>12</sup> 
and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that is the principal city). 

<sup>13</sup> 
Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 

<sup>14</sup> 
Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim). 

<sup>15</sup> 
Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth; 

<sup>16</sup> 
the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite; 

<sup>17</sup> 
the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite; 

<sup>18</sup> 
the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 

<sup>19</sup> 
And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 

<sup>20</sup> 
These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands and in their nations. 

<sup>21</sup> 
And children were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder. 

<sup>22</sup> 
The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 

<sup>23</sup> 
The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. 

<sup>25</sup> 
To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 

<sup>27</sup> 
Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 

<sup>28</sup> 
Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 

<sup>29</sup> 
Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 

<sup>30</sup> 
And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 

<sup>31</sup> 
These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations. 

<sup>32</sup> 
These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.
