<sup>1</sup> 
Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. 

<sup>2</sup> 
And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. 

<sup>3</sup> 
Then they said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. 

<sup>4</sup> 
And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth." 

<sup>5</sup> 
But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 

<sup>6</sup> 
And the Lord said, "Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. 

<sup>7</sup> 
Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." 

<sup>8</sup> 
So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.

<sup>10</sup> 
This is the genealogy of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old, and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood. 

<sup>11</sup> 
After he begot Arphaxad, Shem lived five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>12</sup> 
Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Salah. 

<sup>13</sup> 
After he begot Salah, Arphaxad lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>14</sup> 
Salah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. 

<sup>15</sup> 
After he begot Eber, Salah lived four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>16</sup> 
Eber lived thirty-four years, and begot Peleg. 

<sup>17</sup> 
After he begot Peleg, Eber lived four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>18</sup> 
Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. 

<sup>19</sup> 
After he begot Reu, Peleg lived two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>20</sup> 
Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Serug. 

<sup>21</sup> 
After he begot Serug, Reu lived two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>22</sup> 
Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor. 

<sup>23</sup> 
After he begot Nahor, Serug lived two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>24</sup> 
Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and begot Terah. 

<sup>25</sup> 
After he begot Terah, Nahor lived one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters. 

<sup>26</sup> 
Now Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

<sup>27</sup> 
This is the genealogy of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran begot Lot. 

<sup>28</sup> 
And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 

<sup>29</sup> 
Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah. 

<sup>30</sup> 
But Sarai was barren; she had no child. 

<sup>31</sup> 
And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran and dwelt there. 

<sup>32</sup> 
So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
