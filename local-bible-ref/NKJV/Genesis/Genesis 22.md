<sup>1</sup> 
Now it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham, and said to him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Here I am." 

<sup>2</sup> 
Then He said, "Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you." 

<sup>3</sup> 
So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 

<sup>4</sup> 
Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. 

<sup>5</sup> 
And Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you." 

<sup>6</sup> 
So Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together. 

<sup>7</sup> 
But Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, "My father!" And he said, "Here I am, my son." Then he said, "Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?" 

<sup>8</sup> 
And Abraham said, "My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering." So the two of them went together. 

<sup>9</sup> 
Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 

<sup>10</sup> 
And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 

<sup>11</sup> 
But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, "Abraham, Abraham!" So he said, "Here I am." 

<sup>12</sup> 
And He said, "Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me." 

<sup>13</sup> 
Then Abraham lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son. 

<sup>14</sup> 
And Abraham called the name of the place, The-Lord-Will-Provide; as it is said to this day, "In the Mount of the Lord it shall be provided." 

<sup>15</sup> 
Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, 

<sup>16</sup> 
and said: "By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son-- 

<sup>17</sup> 
blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. 

<sup>18</sup> 
In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice." 

<sup>19</sup> 
So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

<sup>20</sup> 
Now it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, "Indeed Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 

<sup>21</sup> 
Huz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 

<sup>22</sup> 
Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel." 

<sup>23</sup> 
And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 

<sup>24</sup> 
His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.
