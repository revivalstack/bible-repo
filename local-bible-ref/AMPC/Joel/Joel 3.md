<sup>1</sup> 

For behold, in those days and at that time when I shall reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will gather all nations and will bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, and there will I deal with and execute judgment upon them for [their treatment of] My people and of My heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations and [because] they have divided My land. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they have cast lots for My people, and have given a boy for a harlot and have sold a girl for juice [of the grape] and have drunk it. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Yes, and what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the [five small] divisions of Philistia? Will you pay Me back for something? Even if you pay Me back, swiftly and speedily I will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried into your temples and palaces My precious treasures, 

<sup>6</sup> 

And have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Grecians, that you may remove them far from their border. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Behold, I will stir them up out of the place to which you have sold them and will return your deed [of retaliation] upon your own head. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off, for the Lord has spoken it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare war! Stir up the mighty men! Let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong [a warrior]! 

<sup>11</sup> 

Hasten and come, all you nations round about, and assemble yourselves; there You, O Lord, will bring down Your mighty ones (Your warriors). 

<sup>12</sup> 

Let the nations bestir themselves and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Put in the sickle, for the [vintage] harvest is ripe; come, get down and tread the grapes, for the winepress is full; the vats overflow, for the wickedness [of the peoples] is great. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The sun and the moon are darkened and the stars withdraw their shining. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The Lord will thunder and roar from Zion and utter His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be a refuge for His people and a stronghold to the children of Israel. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So shall you know, understand, and realize that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain. Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and strangers and foreigners [not born into the family of God] shall no more pass through it. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And in that day, the mountains shall drip with fresh juice [of the grape] and the hills shall flow with milk; and all the brooks and riverbeds of Judah shall flow with water, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the Lord and shall water the Valley of Shittim. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Egypt shall be a desolation and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness for their violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But Judah shall remain and be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And I will cleanse and hold as innocent their blood and avenge it, blood which I have not cleansed, held innocent, and avenged, for the Lord dwells in Zion.
