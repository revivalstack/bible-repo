The Lord said also to Joshua, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, Appoint among you cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses, 

<sup>3</sup> 

That the slayer who kills anyone accidentally and unintentionally may flee there; and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He who flees to one of those cities shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city; they shall receive him to [the protection of] that city and give him a place to dwell among them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

If the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not deliver the slayer into his hand, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally, having had no hatred for him previously. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And he shall dwell in that city until he has been tried before the congregation and until the death of him who is the high priest in those days. Then the slayer shall return to his own city from which he fled and to his own house. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And they set apart and consecrated Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho they appointed Bezer in the wilderness tableland from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 

<sup>9</sup> 

These cities were for all the Israelites and the stranger sojourning among them, that whoever killed a person unintentionally might flee there and not be slain by the avenger of blood until he had been tried before the congregation.
