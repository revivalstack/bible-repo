The allotment for the people of Joseph went from the Jordan by Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, going up from Jericho into the hill country to Bethel; 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then it went from Bethel to Luz and passed on to Ataroth, the border of the Archites. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And it went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the outskirts of Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and ended at the sea. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The descendants of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The boundary of the Ephraimites according to their families was thus: on the east side their border was Ataroth-addar as far as Upper Beth-horon. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then the boundary went from there to the sea; on the north was Michmethath; then on the east the boundary went out to Taanath-shiloh, and eastward to Janoah, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, touched Jericho, and ended at the Jordan [River]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The border went out from Tappuah westward to the brook Kanah and ended at the [Mediterranean] Sea. This is the inheritance of the Ephraimites by their families, 

<sup>9</sup> 

With the towns set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites, all those towns with their villages. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But they did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, and they became slaves required to do forced labor.
