<sup>1</sup> 

But the Israelites committed a trespass in regard to the devoted things; for Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the things devoted [for destruction]. And the anger of the Lord burned against Israel. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up and spied out Ai. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they returned to Joshua and said to him, Let not all the men go up; but let about two thousand or three thousand go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole army toil up there, for they of Ai are few. 

<sup>4</sup> 

So about three thousand Israelites went up there, but they fled before the men of Ai. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the men of Ai killed about thirty-six of them, for they chased them from before the gate as far as Shebarim, and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted and became as water. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then Joshua rent his clothes and lay on the earth upon his face before the ark of the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust on their heads. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Joshua said, Alas, O Lord God, why have You brought this people over the Jordan at all only to give us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan! 

<sup>8</sup> 

O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned to flee before their enemies! 

<sup>9</sup> 

For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name? 

<sup>10</sup> 

The Lord said to Joshua, Get up! Why do you lie thus upon your face? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Israel has sinned; they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them. They have taken some of the things devoted [for destruction]; they have stolen, and lied, and put them among their own baggage. 

<sup>12</sup> 

That is why the Israelites could not stand before their enemies, but fled before them; they are accursed and have become devoted [for destruction]. I will cease to be with you unless you destroy the accursed [devoted] things among you. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Up, sanctify (set apart for a holy purpose) the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: There are accursed things in the midst of you, O Israel. You can not stand before your enemies until you take away from among you the things devoted [to destruction]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

In the morning therefore, you shall present your tribes. And the tribe which the Lord takes shall come by families; and the family which the Lord takes shall come by households; and the household which the Lord takes shall come by persons. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be [killed and his body] burned with fire, he and all he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord and because he has done a shameful and wicked thing in Israel. 

<sup>16</sup> 

So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel near by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He brought near the family of Judah, and the family of the Zerahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zerahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He brought near his household man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession to Him. And tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And Achan answered Joshua, In truth, I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and this have I done: 

<sup>21</sup> 

When I saw among the spoils an attractive mantle from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath. 

<sup>22</sup> 

So Joshua sent messengers, who ran to the tent, and behold, the spoil was hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and laid them out before the Lord. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, and the silver, the garment, the wedge of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them to the Valley of Achor. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And Joshua said, Why have you brought trouble on us? The Lord will trouble you this day. And all Israel stoned him and those with him with stones, and afterward burned their bodies with fire. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor or Troubling to this day.
