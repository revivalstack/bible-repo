When all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and there was no spirit in them any more because of the Israelites. 

<sup>2</sup> 

At that time the Lord said to Joshua, Make knives of flint and circumcise the [new generation of] Israelites as before. 

<sup>3</sup> 

So Joshua made knives of flint and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And this is the reason Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way after they came out of Egypt. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Though all the people who came out were circumcised, yet all the people who were born in the wilderness on the way after Israel came out of Egypt had not been circumcised. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For the Israelites walked forty years in the wilderness till all who were men of war who came out of Egypt perished, because they did not hearken to the voice of the Lord; to them the Lord swore that He would not let them see the land which the Lord swore to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 

<sup>7</sup> 

So it was their uncircumcised children whom He raised up in their stead whom Joshua circumcised, because the rite had not been performed on the way. 

<sup>8</sup> 

When they finished circumcising all the males of the nation, they remained in their places in the camp till they were healed. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the Lord said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you. So the name of the place is called Gilgal [rolling] to this day. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the Israelites encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And on that same day they ate the produce of the land: unleavened cakes and parched grain. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the manna ceased on the day after they ate of the produce of the land; and the Israelites had manna no more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 

<sup>13</sup> 

When Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up, and behold, a Man stood near him with His drawn sword in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, Are you for us or for our adversaries? 

<sup>14</sup> 

And He said, No [neither], but as Prince of the Lord's host have I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, What says my Lord to His servant? 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the Prince of the Lord's host said to Joshua, Loose your shoes from off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy. And Joshua did so.
