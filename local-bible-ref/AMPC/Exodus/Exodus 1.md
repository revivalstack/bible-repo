These are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt with Jacob, each with his household: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher. 

<sup>5</sup> 

All the offspring of Jacob were seventy persons; Joseph was already in Egypt. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But the descendants of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was full of them. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Now a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He said to his people, Behold, the Israelites are too many and too mighty for us [and they outnumber us both in people and in strength]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply more and, should war befall us, they join our enemies, fight against us, and escape out of the land. 

<sup>11</sup> 

So they set over [the Israelites] taskmasters to afflict and oppress them with [increased] burdens. And [the Israelites] built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But the more [the Egyptians] oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that [the Egyptians] were vexed and alarmed because of the Israelites. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And the Egyptians reduced the Israelites to severe slavery. 

<sup>14</sup> 

They made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar, brick, and all kinds of work in the field. All their service was with harshness and severity. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom one was named Shiprah and the other Puah, 

<sup>16</sup> 

When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but let the male babies live. 

<sup>18</sup> 

So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, Why have you done this thing and allowed the male children to live? 

<sup>19</sup> 

The midwives answered Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and quickly delivered; their babies are born before the midwife comes to them. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and became very strong. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And because the midwives revered and feared God, He made them households [of their own]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son born [to the Hebrews] you shall cast into the river [Nile], but every daughter you shall allow to live.
