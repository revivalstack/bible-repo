Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord, saying, I will sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider or its chariot has He thrown into the sea. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord is my Strength and my Song, and He has become my Salvation; this is my God, and I will praise Him, my father's God, and I will exalt Him. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The Lord is a Man of War; the Lord is His name. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Pharaoh's chariots and his host has He cast into the sea; his chosen captains also are sunk in the Red Sea. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The floods cover them; they sank in the depths [clad in mail] like a stone. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power; Your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy. 

<sup>7</sup> 

In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow those rising against You. You send forth Your fury; it consumes them like stubble. 

<sup>8</sup> 

With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up, the floods stood fixed in a heap, the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You [Lord] blew with Your wind, the sea covered them; [clad in mail] they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like You, glorious in holiness, awesome in splendor, doing wonders? 

<sup>12</sup> 

You stretched out Your right hand, the earth's [sea] swallowed them. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You in Your mercy and loving-kindness have led forth the people whom You have redeemed; You have guided them in Your strength to Your holy habitation. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The peoples have heard of it; they tremble; pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Now the chiefs of Edom are dismayed; the mighty men of Moab [renowned for strength], trembling takes hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away--little by little. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Terror and dread fall upon them; because of the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone--till Your people pass by and over [into Canaan], O Lord, till the people pass by whom You have purchased. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You will bring them in [to the land] and plant them on Your own mountain, the place, O Lord, You have made for Your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The Lord will reign forever and ever. 

<sup>19</sup> 

For the horses of Pharaoh went with his chariots and horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought back the waters of the sea upon them, but the Israelites walked on dry ground in the midst of the sea. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dancing. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And Miriam responded to them, Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously and is highly exalted; the horse and his rider He has thrown into the sea. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea and they went into the Wilderness of Shur; they went three days [thirty-three miles] in the wilderness and found no water. 

<sup>23</sup> 

When they came to Marah, they could not drink its waters for they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah [bitterness]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 

<sup>25</sup> 

And he cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There [the Lord] made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He proved them, 

<sup>26</sup> 

Saying, If you will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God and will do what is right in His sight, and will listen to and obey His commandments and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon you which I brought upon the Egyptians, for I am the Lord Who heals you. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
