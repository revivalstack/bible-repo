In the third month after the Israelites left the land of Egypt, the same day, they came into the Wilderness of Sinai. 

<sup>2</sup> 

When they had departed from Rephidim and had come to the Wilderness of Sinai, they encamped there before the mountain. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him out of the mountain, Say this to the house of Jacob and tell the Israelites: 

<sup>4</sup> 

You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Now therefore, if you will obey My voice in truth and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own peculiar possession and treasure from among and above all peoples; for all the earth is Mine. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation [consecrated, set apart to the worship of God]. These are the words you shall speak to the Israelites. 

<sup>7</sup> 

So Moses called for the elders of the people and told them all these words which the Lord commanded him. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you and believe you and remain steadfast forever. Then Moses told the words of the people to the Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, Go and sanctify the people [set them apart for God] today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes 

<sup>11</sup> 

And be ready by the third day, for the third day the Lord will come down upon Mount Sinai [in the cloud] in the sight of all the people. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And you shall set bounds for the people round about, saying, Take heed that you go not up into the mountain or touch the border of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. 

<sup>13</sup> 

No hand shall touch it [or the offender], but he shall surely be stoned or shot [with arrows]; whether beast or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain. 

<sup>14</sup> 

So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [set them apart for God], and they washed their clothes. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And he said to the people, Be ready by the day after tomorrow; do not go near a woman. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The third morning there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then Moses brought the people from the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke, for the Lord descended upon it in fire; its smoke ascended like that of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. 

<sup>19</sup> 

As the trumpet blast grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with a voice. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain, and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The Lord said to Moses, Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to gaze and many of them perish. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And also let the priests, who come near to the Lord, sanctify (set apart) themselves [for God], lest the Lord break forth against them. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And Moses said to the Lord, The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for You Yourself charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mountain and sanctify it [set it apart for God]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then the Lord said to him, Go, get down and you shall come up, you and Aaron with you; but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, lest He break forth against them. 

<sup>25</sup> 

So Moses went down to the people and told them.
