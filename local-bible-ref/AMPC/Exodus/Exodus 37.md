Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood--two cubits and a half was the length of it, a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He overlaid it with pure gold within and without and made a molding or crown of gold to go around the top of it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He cast four rings of gold for its four corners, two rings on either side. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 

<sup>5</sup> 

He put the poles through the rings at the sides of the ark to carry it. 

<sup>6</sup> 

[Bezalel] made the mercy seat of pure gold, two cubits and a half its length and one cubit and a half its breadth. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And he made two cherubim of beaten gold; on the two ends of the mercy seat he made them, 

<sup>8</sup> 

One cherub at one end and one at the other end; of one piece with the mercy seat he made the cherubim at its two ends. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces to each other, looking down to the mercy seat. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Bezalel made the [showbread] table of acacia wood; it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He overlaid it with pure gold and made a molding of gold around its top. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And he made a border around it [just under the top] a handbreadth wide, and a molding of gold around the border. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And he cast for it four rings of gold and fastened the rings on the four corners that were at its four legs. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Close to the border were the rings, the places for the poles to pass through to carry the [showbread] table. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[Bezalel] made the poles of acacia wood to carry the [showbread] table and overlaid them with gold. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He made of pure gold the vessels which were to be on the table, its plates and dishes [for bread], its bowls and flagons for pouring [liquid sacrifices]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And he made the lampstand of pure gold; its base and shaft were made of hammered work; its cups, its knobs, and its flowers were of one piece with it. 

<sup>18</sup> 

There were six branches going out of the sides of the lampstand, three branches out of one side of it and three branches out of the other side of it; 

<sup>19</sup> 

Three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, each with a [calyx] knob and a flower, and three cups made like almond blossoms in the [opposite] branch, each with a [calyx] knob and a flower; and so for the six branches going out of the lampstand. 

<sup>20</sup> 

On [the shaft of] the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms, with knobs and flowers [one at the top]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And a knob under each pair of branches, of one piece with the lampstand, for the six branches going out of it. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Their knobs and their branches were of one piece with it, all of it hammered work of pure gold. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And he made of pure gold its seven lamps, its snuffers, and its ashtrays. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Of a talent of pure gold he made the lampstand and all its utensils. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And [Bezalel] made the incense altar of acacia wood; its top was a cubit square and it was two cubits high; the horns were one piece with it. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides round about, and its horns; also he made a rim around it of gold. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And he made two rings of gold for it under its rim, on its two opposite sides, as places for the poles [to pass through] to carry it. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 

<sup>29</sup> 

He also made the holy anointing oil [symbol of the Holy Spirit] and the pure, fragrant incense, after the perfumer's art.
