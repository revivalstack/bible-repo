<sup>1</sup> 

This is what you shall do to consecrate (set them apart) that they may serve Me as priests. Take one young bull and two rams, all without blemish, 

<sup>2</sup> 

And unleavened bread and unleavened cakes mixed with oil and unleavened wafers spread with oil; of fine flour shall you make them. 

<sup>3</sup> 

You shall put them in one basket and bring them in [it], and bring also the bull and the two rams; 

<sup>4</sup> 

And bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the Tent of Meeting [out where the laver is] and wash them with water. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then take the garments and put on Aaron the long and sleeved tunic and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastplate, and gird him with the skillfully woven girding band of the ephod. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And you shall put the turban or miter upon his head and put the holy crown upon the turban. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And bring his sons and put long and sleeved tunics on them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And you shall gird them with sashes or belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind caps on them; and the priest's office shall be theirs by a perpetual statute. Thus you shall ordain and consecrate Aaron and his sons. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then bring the bull before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon its head. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And you shall kill the bull before the Lord by the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And you shall take of the blood of the bull and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger, and pour out all the blood at the base of the altar. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And take all the fat that covers the entrails, and the appendage that is on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, and burn them on the altar. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But the flesh of the bull, its hide, and the contents of its entrails you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering. 

<sup>15</sup> 

You shall also take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And you shall kill the ram and you shall take its blood and throw it against the altar round about. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And you shall cut the ram in pieces and wash its entrails and legs and put them with its pieces and its head, 

<sup>18</sup> 

And you shall burn the whole ram upon the altar. It is a burnt offering to the Lord; it is a sweet and satisfying fragrance, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram; 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then you shall kill the ram and take part of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ears of Aaron and his sons and on the thumb of their right hands and on the great toe of their right feet, and dash the rest of the blood against the altar round about. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then you shall take part of the blood that is on the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments; and he and his garments and his sons and their garments shall be sanctified and made holy. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Also you shall take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails, the appendage on the liver, the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh; for it is a ram of consecration and ordination. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Take also one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and they shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Then you shall take them from their hands, add them to the burnt offering, and burn them on the altar for a sweet and satisfying fragrance before the Lord; it is an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration and ordination and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be your portion [Moses]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And you shall sanctify (set apart for God) the waved breast of the ram used in the ordination and the waved thigh of the priests' portion, since it is for Aaron and his sons. 

<sup>28</sup> 

It shall be for Aaron and his sons as their due portion from the Israelites perpetually, an offering from the Israelites of their peace and thanksgiving sacrifices, their offering to the Lord. 

<sup>29</sup> 

The holy garments of Aaron shall pass to his descendants who succeed him, to be anointed in them and to be consecrated and ordained in them. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And that son who is [high] priest in his stead shall put them on [each day for] seven days when he comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place. 

<sup>31</sup> 

You shall take the ram of the consecration and ordination and boil its flesh in a holy and set-apart place. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread in the basket, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>33</sup> 

They shall eat those things with which atonement was made, to ordain and consecrate them; but a stranger (layman) shall not eat of them because they are holy (set apart to the worship of God). 

<sup>34</sup> 

And if any of the flesh or bread for the ordination remains until morning, you shall burn it with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy (set apart to the worship of God). 

<sup>35</sup> 

Thus shall you do to Aaron and to his sons according to all I have commanded you; during seven days shall you ordain them. 

<sup>36</sup> 

You shall offer every day a bull as a sin offering for atonement. And you shall cleanse the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and sanctify it [set it apart for God]; and the altar shall be most holy; whoever or whatever touches the altar must be holy (set apart for God's service). 

<sup>38</sup> 

Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs a year old shall be offered day by day continually. 

<sup>39</sup> 

One lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb in the evening; 

<sup>40</sup> 

And with the one lamb a tenth measure of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering [to be poured out]. 

<sup>41</sup> 

And the other lamb you shall offer at evening, and do with it as with the cereal offering of the morning and with the drink offering, for a sweet and satisfying fragrance, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>42</sup> 

This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the Tent of Meeting before the Lord, where I will meet with you to speak there to you. 

<sup>43</sup> 

There I will meet with the Israelites, and the Tent of Meeting shall be sanctified by My glory [the Shekinah, God's visible presence]. 

<sup>44</sup> 

And I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting and the altar; I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to Me in the priest's office. 

<sup>45</sup> 

And I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God. 

<sup>46</sup> 

And they shall know [from personal experience] that I am the Lord their God, Who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I might dwell among them; I am the Lord their God.
