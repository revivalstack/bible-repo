<sup>1</sup> 

Bezalel and Aholiab and every wisehearted man in whom the Lord has put wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work for the service of the sanctuary shall work according to all that the Lord has commanded. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab and every able and wisehearted man in whose mind the Lord had put wisdom and ability, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work; 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they received from Moses all the freewill offerings which the Israelites had brought for doing the work of the sanctuary, to prepare it for service. And they continued to bring him freewill offerings every morning. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And all the wise and able men who were doing the work on the sanctuary came, every man from the work he was doing, 

<sup>5</sup> 

And they said to Moses, The people bring much more than enough for doing the work which the Lord commanded to do. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So Moses commanded and it was proclaimed in all the camp, Let no man or woman do anything more for the sanctuary offering. So the people were restrained from bringing, 

<sup>7</sup> 

For the stuff they had was sufficient to do all the work and more. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And all the able and wisehearted men among them who did the work on the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff], with cherubim skillfully worked on them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits and its breadth four cubits; all the curtains were one size. 

<sup>10</sup> 

[Bezalel] coupled five curtains one to another and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And he made loops of blue on the outer edge of the last curtain in the first set; this he did also on the inner edge of the first curtain in the second set. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Fifty loops he made in the one curtain and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which was the second set; the loops were opposite one another. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And he made fifty clasps of gold and coupled the curtains together with the clasps so that the tabernacle became one unit. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And he made eleven curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The length of one curtain was thirty cubits and four cubits was the breadth; the eleven curtains were of equal size. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he coupled five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And he made fifty loops on the outmost edge of the curtain to be coupled and fifty loops he made on the inner edge of the second curtain to be coupled. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together into one whole. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins tanned red, and above it a covering of dolphin or porpoise skins. 

<sup>20</sup> 

He made boards of acacia wood for the upright framework of the tabernacle. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The length of a board was ten cubits and the breadth one cubit and a half. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Each board had two tenons (projections) to fit into a mortise to form a clutch; he did this for all the boards of the tabernacle. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And he made thus the boards [for frames] for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side, 

<sup>24</sup> 

And he made under the twenty boards forty sockets or bases of silver, two sockets under one board for its two tenons or hands, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 

<sup>25</sup> 

For the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards 

<sup>26</sup> 

And their forty sockets or bases of silver, two sockets under [the end of] each board. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And for the rear or west side of the tabernacle he made six [frame] boards. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And two boards he made for each corner of the tabernacle in the rear. 

<sup>29</sup> 

They were separate below but linked together at the top with one ring; thus he made both of them in both corners. 

<sup>30</sup> 

There were eight boards with sixteen sockets or bases of silver, and under [the end of] each board two sockets. 

<sup>31</sup> 

He made bars of acacia wood, five for the [frame] boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 

<sup>32</sup> 

And five bars for the boards of its other side, and five bars for the boards at the rear or west side. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And he made the middle bar pass through halfway up the boards from one end to the other. 

<sup>34</sup> 

He overlaid the boards and the bars with gold and made their rings of gold as places for the bars. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And he made the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff] and fine twined linen, with cherubim skillfully worked. 

<sup>36</sup> 

For [the veil] he made four pillars of acacia [wood] and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold, and he cast for them four sockets or bases of silver. 

<sup>37</sup> 

And he made a screen for the tent door of blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff] and fine twined linen, embroidered, 

<sup>38</sup> 

And he made the five pillars of it with their hooks, and overlaid their ornamental tops and joinings with gold, but their five sockets were of bronze.
