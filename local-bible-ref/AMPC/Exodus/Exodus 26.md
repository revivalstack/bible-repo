<sup>1</sup> 

Moreover, you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet [stuff], with cherubim skillfully embroidered shall you make them. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The length of one curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; each of the curtains shall measure the same. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The five curtains shall be coupled to one another, and the other five curtains shall be coupled to one another. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And you shall make loops of blue on the edge of the last curtain in the first set, and likewise in the second set. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Fifty loops you shall make on the one curtain and fifty loops on the edge of the last curtain that is in the second coupling or set, so that the loops on one correspond to the loops on the other. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And you shall make fifty clasps of gold and fasten the curtains together with the clasps; then the tabernacle shall be one whole. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And make curtains of goats' hair to be a [second] covering over the tabernacle; eleven curtains shall you make. 

<sup>8</sup> 

One curtain shall be thirty cubits long and four cubits wide; and the eleven curtains shall all measure the same. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You shall join together five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves, and shall double over the sixth curtain in the front of the tabernacle [to make a closed door]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And make fifty loops on the edge of the outmost curtain in the one set and fifty loops on the edge of the outmost curtain in the second set. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You shall make fifty clasps of bronze and put the clasps into the loops and couple the tent together, that it may be one whole. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The surplus that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the back of the tabernacle. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And the cubit on the one side and the cubit on the other side of what remains in the length of the curtains of the tent shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle, on this side and that side, to cover it. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall make a [third] covering for the tent of rams' skins tanned red, and a [fourth] covering above that of dolphin or porpoise skins. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And you shall make the upright frame for the tabernacle of boards of acacia wood. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Ten cubits shall be the length of a board and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Make two tenons in each board for dovetailing and fitting together; so shall you do for all the tabernacle boards. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And make the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side; 

<sup>19</sup> 

And you shall make forty silver sockets under the twenty boards, two sockets under each board for its two tenons. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And for the north side of the tabernacle there shall be twenty boards 

<sup>21</sup> 

And their forty silver sockets, two sockets under each board. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For the back or west side of the tabernacle you shall make six boards. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Make two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the rear on both sides. 

<sup>24</sup> 

They shall be coupled down below and coupled together on top with one ring. Thus shall it be for both of them; they shall form the two corners. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And that will be eight boards and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets, two sockets under each board. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And you shall make bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of one side, 

<sup>27</sup> 

And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the rear end of the tabernacle, for the back wall to the west. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And the middle bar halfway up the boards shall pass through from end to end. 

<sup>29</sup> 

You shall overlay the boards with gold and make their rings of gold to hold the bars and overlay the bars with gold. 

<sup>30</sup> 

You shall erect the tabernacle after the plan of it shown you on the mountain. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff] and fine twined linen, skillfully worked with cherubim on it. 

<sup>32</sup> 

You shall hang it on four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold, with gold hooks, on four sockets of silver. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And you shall hang the veil from the clasps and bring the ark of the Testimony into place within the veil; and the veil shall separate for you the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. 

<sup>34</sup> 

And you shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And you shall set the table [for the showbread] outside the veil [in the Holy Place] on the north side and the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle. 

<sup>36</sup> 

You shall make a hanging [to form a screen] for the door of the tent of blue, purple, and scarlet [stuff] and fine twined linen, embroidered. 

<sup>37</sup> 

You shall make five pillars of acacia wood to support the hanging curtain and overlay them with gold; their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five [base] sockets of bronze for them.
