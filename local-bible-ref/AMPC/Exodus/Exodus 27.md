All the tabernacle's utensils and instruments used in all its service, and all its pegs and all the pegs for the court, shall be of bronze. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You shall command the Israelites to provide you with pure oil of crushed olives for the light, to cause it to burn continually [every night].
