And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom and ability, in understanding and intelligence, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship, 

<sup>4</sup> 

To devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, 

<sup>5</sup> 

And in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of craftsmanship. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And behold, I have appointed with him Aholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and to all who are wisehearted I have given wisdom and ability to make all that I have commanded you: 

<sup>7</sup> 

The Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furnishings of the tent-- 

<sup>8</sup> 

The table [of the showbread] and its utensils, the pure lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense, 

<sup>9</sup> 

The altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the laver and its base-- 

<sup>10</sup> 

The finely worked garments, the holy garments for Aaron the [high] priest and for his sons to minister as priests, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And the anointing oil and incense of sweet spices for the Holy Place. According to all that I have commanded you shall they do. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>13</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, Truly you shall keep My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you [set you apart for Myself]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you; everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does work on the Sabbath shall be cut off from among his people. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Six days may work be done, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, sacred to the Lord; whoever does work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Wherefore the Israelites shall keep the Sabbath to observe it throughout their generations, a perpetual covenant. 

<sup>17</sup> 

It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the Lord made the heavens and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and was refreshed. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And He gave to Moses, when He had ceased communing with him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of the Testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
