<sup>1</sup> 

But as to the suitable times and the precise seasons and dates, brethren, you have no necessity for anything being written to you. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the [return of the] Lord will come [as unexpectedly and suddenly] as a thief in the night. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When people are saying, All is well and secure, and, There is peace and safety, then in a moment unforeseen destruction (ruin and death) will come upon them as suddenly as labor pains come upon a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape, for there will be no escape. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But you are not in [given up to the power of] darkness, brethren, for that day to overtake you by surprise like a thief. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For you are all sons of light and sons of the day; we do not belong either to the night or to darkness. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Accordingly then, let us not sleep, as the rest do, but let us keep wide awake (alert, watchful, cautious, and on our guard) and let us be sober (calm, collected, and circumspect). 

<sup>7</sup> 

For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But we belong to the day; therefore, let us be sober and put on the breastplate (corslet) of faith and love and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For God has not appointed us to [incur His] wrath [He did not select us to condemn us], but [that we might] obtain [His] salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who died for us so that whether we are still alive or are dead [at Christ's appearing], we might live together with Him and share His life. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Therefore encourage (admonish, exhort) one another and edify (strengthen and build up) one another, just as you are doing. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Now also we beseech you, brethren, get to know those who labor among you [recognize them for what they are, acknowledge and appreciate and respect them all]--your leaders who are over you in the Lord and those who warn and kindly reprove and exhort you. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And hold them in very high and most affectionate esteem in [intelligent and sympathetic] appreciation of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And we earnestly beseech you, brethren, admonish (warn and seriously advise) those who are out of line [the loafers, the disorderly, and the unruly]; encourage the timid and fainthearted, help and give your support to the weak souls, [and] be very patient with everybody [always keeping your temper]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

See that none of you repays another with evil for evil, but always aim to show kindness and seek to do good to one another and to everybody. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Be happy [in your faith] and rejoice and be glad-hearted continually (always); 

<sup>17</sup> 

Be unceasing in prayer [praying perseveringly]; 

<sup>18</sup> 

Thank [God] in everything [no matter what the circumstances may be, be thankful and give thanks], for this is the will of God for you [who are] in Christ Jesus [the Revealer and Mediator of that will]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Do not quench (suppress or subdue) the [Holy] Spirit; 

<sup>20</sup> 

Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But test and prove all things [until you can recognize] what is good; [to that] hold fast. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Abstain from evil [shrink from it and keep aloof from it] in whatever form or whatever kind it may be. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through [separate you from profane things, make you pure and wholly consecrated to God]; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved sound and complete [and found] blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 

<sup>24</sup> 

Faithful is He Who is calling you [to Himself] and utterly trustworthy, and He will also do it [fulfill His call by hallowing and keeping you]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Brethren, pray for us. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Greet all the brethren with a sacred kiss. 

<sup>27</sup> 

I solemnly charge you [in the name of] the Lord to have this letter read before all the brethren. 

<sup>28</sup> 

The grace (the unmerited favor and blessings) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen, (so be it).
