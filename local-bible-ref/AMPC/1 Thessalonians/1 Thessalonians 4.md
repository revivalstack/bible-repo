<sup>1</sup> 

Furthermore, brethren, we beg and admonish you in [virtue of our union with] the Lord Jesus, that [you follow the instructions which] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God, as indeed you are doing, [and] that you do so even more and more abundantly [attaining yet greater perfection in living this life]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [on the authority and by the inspiration of] the Lord Jesus. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For this is the will of God, that you should be consecrated (separated and set apart for pure and holy living): that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice, 

<sup>4</sup> 

That each one of you should know how to possess (control, manage) his own body in consecration (purity, separated from things profane) and honor, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Not [to be used] in the passion of lust like the heathen, who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will, 

<sup>6</sup> 

That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we have already warned you solemnly and told you plainly. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Therefore whoever disregards (sets aside and rejects this) disregards not man but God, Whose [very] Spirit [Whom] He gives to you is holy (chaste, pure). 

<sup>9</sup> 

But concerning brotherly love [for all other Christians], you have no need to have anyone write you, for you yourselves have been [personally] taught by God to love one another. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And indeed you already are [extending and displaying your love] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we beseech and earnestly exhort you, brethren, that you excel [in this matter] more and more, 

<sup>11</sup> 

To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we charged you, 

<sup>12</sup> 

So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world, being dependent on nobody [self-supporting] and having need of nothing. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Now also we would not have you ignorant, brethren, about those who fall asleep [in death], that you may not grieve [for them] as the rest do who have no hope [beyond the grave]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [in death]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

For this we declare to you by the Lord's [own] word, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [into His presence] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [in Him in death]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the blast of the trumpet of God. And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then we, the living ones who remain [on the earth], shall simultaneously be caught up along with [the resurrected dead] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so always (through the eternity of the eternities) we shall be with the Lord! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words.
