Now the leaders of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; the rest of the people also cast lots to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city, while nine-tenths dwelt in other towns and villages. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered to live in Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup>

<sup>20</sup> 

And the rest of Israel, with the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each in his inheritance. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But the temple servants dwelt on [the hill] Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were over [them]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Overseer of the Levites in Jerusalem and the work of God's house was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of Asaph's sons, the singers. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For the [Persian] king had ordered concerning them that a certain provision be made for the singers, as each day required. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the people. 

<sup>25</sup> 

As for the villages with their fields, some people of Judah dwelt in Kiriath-arba, Dibon, and Jekabzeel, and their villages,
