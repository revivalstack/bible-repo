But when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and in a great rage, and he ridiculed the Jews. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And he said before his brethren and the army of Samaria, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things [at will and by themselves]? Will they [try to bribe their God] with sacrifices? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Now Tobiah the Ammonite was near him, and he said, What they build--if a fox climbs upon it, he will break down their stone wall. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[And Nehemiah prayed] Hear, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their taunts upon their own heads, and give them for a prey in a land of their captivity. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out before You, for they have vexed [with alarm] the builders and provoked You. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So we built the wall, and all [of it] was joined together to half its height, for the people had a heart and mind to work. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were going up and that the breaches were being closed, they were very angry. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem, to injure and cause confusion and failure in it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But because of them we made our prayer to our God and set a watch against them day and night. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And [the leaders of] Judah said, The strength of the burden bearers is weakening, and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And our enemies said, They will not know or see till we come into their midst and kill them and stop the work. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And when the Jews who lived near them came, they said to us ten times, You must return [to guard our little villages]; from all places where they dwell they will be upon us. 

<sup>13</sup> 

So I set [armed men] behind the wall in places where it was least protected; I even thus used the people as families with their swords, spears, and bows. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I looked [them over] and rose up and said to the nobles and officials and the other people, Do not be afraid of the enemy; [earnestly] remember the Lord and imprint Him [on your minds], great and terrible, and [take from Him courage to] fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And when our enemies heard that their plot was known to us and that God had frustrated their purpose, we all returned to the wall, everyone to his work. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And from that time forth, half of my servants worked at the task, and the other half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Those who built the wall and those who bore burdens loaded themselves so that everyone worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other hand, 

<sup>18</sup> 

And every builder had his sword girded by his side, and so worked. And he who sounded the trumpet was at my side. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And I said to the nobles and officials and the rest of the people, The work is great and scattered, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another. 

<sup>20</sup> 

In whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us. 

<sup>21</sup> 

So we labored at the work while half of them held the spears from dawn until the stars came out. 

<sup>22</sup> 

At that time also I said to the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that at night they may be a guard to us and a laborer during the day. 

<sup>23</sup> 

So none of us--I, my kinsmen, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me--took off our clothes; each kept his weapon [in his hand for days].
