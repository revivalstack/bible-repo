Now when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites had been appointed, 

<sup>2</sup> 

I gave my brother Hanani, with Hananiah the ruler of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for Hananiah was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while the watchmen are still on guard, let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from the people of Jerusalem, each to his watch [on the wall] and each opposite his own house. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Now the city was wide and large, but the people in it were few, and their houses were not yet built. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And my God put it into my mind and heart to assemble the nobles, the officers, and the people, that they might be counted by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who came [from Babylon] at the first, and found written in it: 

<sup>6</sup>

And these were they who went up also from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they [had no birth records and] could not prove their father's house nor their descent, whether they were of Israel: 

<sup>62</sup> 

The sons of Delaiah, of Tobiah, of Nekoda, 642. 

<sup>63</sup> 

Of the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, of Hakkoz, and of Barzillai, who [was so named because he] married one of the daughters of the [noted] Gileadite Barzillai and was called by their name. 

<sup>64</sup> 

These sought their registration among those recorded in the genealogies, but it was not found; so they were excluded from the priesthood as [ceremonially] unclean. 

<sup>65</sup> 

The governor told them that they should refrain from eating any of the most holy food until a priest with Urim and Thummim should arise [to determine the will of God in the matter]. 

<sup>66</sup> 

The congregation all together was 42,360, 

<sup>67</sup> 

Besides their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were 7,337; and they had 245 singers, men and women. 

<sup>68</sup> 

Their horses were 736; their mules, 245; 

<sup>69</sup> 

Their camels, 435; their donkeys, 6,720. 

<sup>70</sup> 

And some of the heads of fathers' houses gave to the work. The Tirshatha or governor gave to the treasury 1,000 darics of gold, 50 basins, 530 priests' garments. 

<sup>71</sup> 

Some of the heads of fathers' houses gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 darics of gold and 2,200 minas of silver. 

<sup>72</sup> 

What the rest of the people gave was 20,000 darics of gold, 2,000 minas of silver, and 67 priests' garments.

So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the Nethinim [the temple servants], along with all Israel, dwelt in their towns, and were in them when the seventh month came.
