<sup>1</sup> 

Also Solomon made an altar of bronze, its top twenty by twenty cubits and its height ten cubits. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Also he made a round Sea of molten metal, ten cubits from brim to brim and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured around it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Under it were figures of oxen encircling it, ten to a cubit. The oxen were in two rows, cast in one piece with it. 

<sup>4</sup> 

It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking north, three west, three south, three east; and the Sea rested upon them, and all their hind parts were inward. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Its thickness was a handbreadth; its brim was like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held 3,000 baths (measures). 

<sup>6</sup> 

He made also ten lavers in which to wash and put five on the right (south) side and five on the left (north). Such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them, but the Sea was for the priests to wash in. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And he made ten golden lampstands as directed and set them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He made also ten tables and placed them in the temple, five each on the right and left sides, and 100 basins of gold. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Moreover, he made the priests' court, and the great court and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And he set the Sea at the southeast corner of the house. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Huram made the pots, shovels, and basins. So Huram finished the work of God's house that he did for King Solomon: 

<sup>12</sup> 

The two pillars; the bowls; the capitals on top of the two pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals on top of the pillars; 

<sup>13</sup> 

And 400 pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals upon the pillars. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He made also bases or stands and lavers upon the bases; 

<sup>15</sup> 

One Sea and the twelve oxen under it; 

<sup>16</sup> 

The pots, shovels, and fleshhooks, and all their equipment Huram his trusted counselor made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 

In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Solomon made all these things in such great numbers that the weight of the bronze was not computed. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God: the golden altar also; and the tables for the showbread (the bread of the Presence); 

<sup>20</sup> 

And the lampstands with their lamps of pure gold, to burn before the inner sanctuary (the Holy of Holies) as directed; 

<sup>21</sup> 

The flowers, lamps, and tongs, of purest gold; 

<sup>22</sup> 

The snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and for the temple entry, the inner doors for the Most Holy Place and the doors of the Holy Place were of gold.
