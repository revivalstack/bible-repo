Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Jeroboam the son of Nebat was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, when he heard about the new king; so Jeroboam returned from Egypt. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And the people sent for him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam, saying, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your father [King Solomon] made our yoke grievous. So now make lighter the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Rehoboam replied, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he was alive, saying, What counsel do you give me in reply to the people? 

<sup>7</sup> 

And they answered him, If you are kind to [these] people and please them and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But the king forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who were brought up with him and stood before him. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And he said to them, What answer do you advise that we give to the demand of [these] people, Make the yoke your father put upon us lighter? 

<sup>10</sup> 

The young men who were brought up with him said to him, Tell the people who said to you, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The third day Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as he had said. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And the king answered them harshly, forsaking the counsel of the old men, 

<sup>14</sup> 

And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So the king did not heed the people, for it was brought about of God, that the Lord might perform His word which He spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to and heed them, they answered [him], What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David [tribe of Judah], see to your own house [under your tyrant King Rehoboam]! So all Israel went to their homes. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But as for the Israelites who dwelt in Judah's cities, Rehoboam ruled over them. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him and he died. But King Rehoboam hastened to get up to his royal chariot to flee to Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.
