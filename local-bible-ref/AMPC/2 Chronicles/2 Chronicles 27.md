He did right in the sight of the Lord, to the extent of all that his father Uzziah had done. However, he did not invade the temple of the Lord. But the people still did corruptly.

He built the Upper Gate of the Lord's house and did much building on the wall of Ophel.

Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built forts and towers.

So Jotham grew mighty, for he ordered his ways in the sight of the Lord his God.
