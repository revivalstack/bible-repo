And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, Keep all the commandments with which I charge you today. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And on the day when you pass over the Jordan to the land which the Lord your God gives you, you shall set up great stones and cover them with plaster. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And you shall write on them all the words of this law when you have passed over, that you may go into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And when you have gone over the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, as I command you this day, on Mount Ebal, and coat them with plaster. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And there you shall build an altar to the Lord your God, an altar of stones; you shall not lift up any iron tool upon them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

You shall build the altar of the Lord your God of whole stones and offer burnt offerings on it to Him; 

<sup>7</sup> 

And you shall offer peace offerings, and eat there and rejoice before the Lord your God. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And you shall write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, Keep silence and hear, O Israel! This day you have become the people of the Lord your God. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So you shall obey the voice of the Lord your God and do His commandments and statutes which I command you today. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 

<sup>12</sup> 

These [tribes] shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you have passed over the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph's [sons], and Benjamin. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And these [tribes] shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce the curse [for disobedience]: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the Levites shall declare with a loud voice to all the men of Israel: 

<sup>15</sup> 

Cursed is the man who makes a graven or molten image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. All the people shall answer, Amen. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Cursed is he who dishonors his father or his mother. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Cursed is he who moves [back] his neighbor's landmark. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Cursed is he who misleads a blind man on his way. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Cursed is he who perverts the justice due to the sojourner or the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Cursed is he who lies with his father's wife, because he uncovers what belongs to his father. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Cursed is he who lies with any beast. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Cursed is he who lies with his half sister, whether his father's or his mother's daughter. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Cursed is he who lies with his mother-in-law. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Cursed is he who slays his neighbor secretly. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Cursed is he who takes a bribe to slay an innocent person. All the people shall say, Amen. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Cursed is he who does not support and give assent to the words of this law to do them [as the rule of his life]. All the people shall say, Amen.
