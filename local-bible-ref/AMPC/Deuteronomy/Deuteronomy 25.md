<sup>1</sup> 

If there is a controversy between men, and they come into court and the judges decide between them, justifying the innocent and condemning the guilty, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then if the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall cause him to lie down and be beaten in his presence with a certain number of stripes according to his offense. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Forty stripes may be given him but not more, lest, if he should be beaten with many stripes, your brother should [be treated like a beast and] seem low and worthless to you. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain. 

<sup>5</sup> 

If brothers live together and one of them dies and has no son, his wife shall not be married outside the family to a stranger [an excluded man]. Her husband's brother shall go in to her and take her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the firstborn son shall succeed to the name of the dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And if the man does not want to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate to the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuses to continue his brother's name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him. And if he stands firm and says, I do not want to take her, 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elders and pull his shoe off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer, So shall it be done to that man who does not build up his brother's house. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And his family shall be called in Israel, The House of Him Whose Shoe Was Loosed. 

<sup>11</sup> 

When men strive together one with another and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband out of the hand of him who is beating him, and puts out her hand and seizes the other man by the private parts, 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then you shall cut off her hand; your eyes shall not pity her. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You shall not have in your bag true and false weights, a large and a small. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall not have in your house true and false measures, a large and a small. 

<sup>15</sup> 

But you shall have a perfect and just weight and a perfect and just measure, that your days may be prolonged in the land which the Lord your God gives you. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For all who do such things, all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to the Lord your God. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Remember what Amalek did to you on the way when you had come forth from Egypt, 

<sup>18</sup> 

How he did not fear God, but when you were faint and weary he attacked you along the way and cut off all the stragglers at your rear. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Therefore when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies round about in the land which the Lord your God gives you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens; you must not forget.
