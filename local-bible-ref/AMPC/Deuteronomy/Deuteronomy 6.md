<sup>1</sup> 

Now this is the instruction, the laws, and the precepts which the Lord your God commanded me to teach you, that you might do them in the land to which you go to possess it, 

<sup>2</sup> 

That you may [reverently] fear the Lord your God, you and your son and your son's son, and keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Hear therefore, O Israel, and be watchful to do them, that it may be well with you and that you may increase exceedingly, as the Lord, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord [the only Lord]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And you shall love the Lord your God with all your [mind and] heart and with your entire being and with all your might. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And these words which I am commanding you this day shall be [first] in your [own] minds and hearts; [then] 

<sup>7</sup> 

You shall whet and sharpen them so as to make them penetrate, and teach and impress them diligently upon the [minds and] hearts of your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets (forehead bands) between your eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And when the Lord your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you, with great and goodly cities which you did not build, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and cisterns hewn out which you did not hew, and vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and when you eat and are full, 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then beware lest you forget the Lord, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You shall [reverently] fear the Lord your God and serve Him and swear by His name [and presence]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall not go after other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who are round about you; 

<sup>15</sup> 

For the Lord your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of the Lord your God be kindled against you, and He destroy you from the face of the earth. 

<sup>16</sup> 

You shall not tempt and try the Lord your God as you tempted and tried Him in Massah. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God and His exhortations and His statutes which He commanded you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may go well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers, 

<sup>19</sup> 

To cast out all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has promised. 

<sup>20</sup> 

When your son asks you in time to come, What is the meaning of the testimonies and statutes and precepts which the Lord our God has commanded you? 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And the Lord showed signs and wonders, great and evil, against Egypt, against Pharaoh, and all his household, before our eyes; 

<sup>23</sup> 

And He brought us out from there, that He might bring us in to give us the land which He swore to give our fathers. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to [reverently] fear the Lord our God for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is this day. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And it will be accounted as righteousness (conformity to God's will in word, thought, and action) for us if we are watchful to do all this commandment before the Lord our God, as He has commanded us.
