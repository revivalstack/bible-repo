And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. And the Lord showed him all the land--from Gilead to Dan, 

<sup>2</sup> 

And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the western [Mediterranean] sea, 

<sup>3</sup> 

And the South (the Negeb) and the plain, that is, the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palm Trees, as far as Zoar. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And the Lord said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your descendants. I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there. 

<sup>5</sup> 

So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord, 

<sup>6</sup> 

And He buried him in the valley of the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Moses was 120 years old when he died; his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; so the Israelites listened to him and did as the Lord commanded Moses. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, 

<sup>11</sup> 

[None equal to him] in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, 

<sup>12</sup> 

And in all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
