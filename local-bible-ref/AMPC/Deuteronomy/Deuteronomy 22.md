<sup>1</sup> 

You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep being driven away or stolen, and hide yourself from [your duty to help] them; you shall surely take them back to your brother. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And if your brother [the owner] is not near you or if you do not know who he is, you shall bring the animal to your house and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it; then you shall restore it to him. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And so shall you do with his donkey or his garment or with anything which your brother has lost and you have found. You shall not hide from [your duty concerning] them. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox fall down by the way, and hide from [your duty concerning] them; you shall surely help him to lift them up again. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment, for all that do so are an abomination to the Lord your God. 

<sup>6</sup> 

If a bird's nest should chance to be before you in the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother bird is sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother bird with the young. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You shall surely let the mother bird go, and take only the young, that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days. 

<sup>8</sup> 

When you build a new house, then you shall put a railing around your [flat] roof, so that no one may fall from there and bring guilt of blood upon your house. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You shall not plant your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the whole crop be forfeited [under this ban], the seed which you have sown and the yield of the vineyard forfeited to the sanctuary. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You shall not plow with an ox [a clean animal] and a donkey [unclean] together. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You shall not wear a garment of mingled stuff, wool and linen together. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You shall make yourself tassels on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself. 

<sup>13</sup> 

If any man takes a wife and goes in to her, and then scorns her 

<sup>14</sup> 

And charges her with shameful things and gives her an evil reputation, and says, I took this woman, but when I came to her, I did not find in her the tokens of a virgin, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then the father of the young woman, and her mother, shall get and bring out the tokens of her virginity to the elders of the city at the gate. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And her father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man as wife, but he hates and spurns her; 

<sup>17</sup> 

And behold, he has made shameful charges against her, saying, I found not in your daughter the evidences of her virginity. And yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the garment before the elders of the city, 

<sup>18</sup> 

And the elders of that city shall take the man and rebuke and whip him. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And they shall fine him 100 shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he may not divorce her all his days. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But if it is true that the evidences of virginity were not found in the young woman, 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then they shall bring her to the door of her father's house and the men of her city shall stone her to death, because she has wrought [criminal] folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's house. So you shall put away the evil from among you. 

<sup>22</sup> 

If a man is found lying with another man's wife, they shall both die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> 

If a maiden who is a virgin is engaged to be married, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her, 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and shall stone them to death--the young woman because she did not cry for help though she was in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor's [promised] wife. So shall you put away evil from among you. 

<sup>25</sup> 

But if a man finds the betrothed maiden in the open country and the man seizes her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no sin punishable by death, for this is as when a man attacks and slays his neighbor, 

<sup>27</sup> 

For he came upon her in the open country, and the betrothed girl cried out, but there was no one to save her. 

<sup>28</sup> 

If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her and they are found, 

<sup>29</sup> 

Then the man who lay with her shall give to the girl's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her; he may not divorce her all his days. 

<sup>30</sup> 

A man shall not take his father's former wife, nor shall he uncover her who belongs to his father.
