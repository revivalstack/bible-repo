<sup>1</sup> 

The wicked flee when no man pursues them, but the [uncompromisingly] righteous are bold as a lion. 

<sup>2</sup> 

When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but when the ruler is a man of discernment, understanding, and knowledge, its stability will long continue. 

<sup>3</sup> 

A poor man who oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food [plundering them of their last morsels]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Those who forsake the law [of God and man] praise the wicked, but those who keep the law [of God and man] contend with them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Evil men do not understand justice, but they who crave and seek the Lord understand it fully. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Better is the poor man who walks in his integrity than he who willfully goes in double and wrong ways, though he is rich. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Whoever keeps the law [of God and man] is a wise son, but he who is a companion of gluttons and the carousing, self-indulgent, and extravagant shames his father. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He who by charging excessive interest and who by unjust efforts to get gain increases his material possession gathers it for him [to spend] who is kind and generous to the poor. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He who turns away his ear from hearing the law [of God and man], even his prayer is an abomination, hateful and revolting [to God]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Whoever leads the upright astray into an evil way, he will himself fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The rich man is wise in his own eyes and conceit, but the poor man who has understanding will find him out. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When the [uncompromisingly] righteous triumph, there is great glory and celebration; but when the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes his sins will obtain mercy. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied) is the man who reverently and worshipfully fears [the Lord] at all times [regardless of circumstances], but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Like a roaring lion or a ravenous and charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 

<sup>16</sup> 

A ruler who lacks understanding is [like a wicked one] a great oppressor, but he who hates covetousness and unjust gain shall prolong his days. 

<sup>17</sup> 

If a man willfully sheds the blood of a person [and keeps the guilt of murder upon his conscience], he is fleeing to the pit (the grave) and hastening to his own destruction; let no man stop him! 

<sup>18</sup> 

He who walks uprightly shall be safe, but he who willfully goes in double and wrong ways shall fall in one of them. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless people and pursuits will have poverty enough. 

<sup>20</sup> 

A faithful man shall abound with blessings, but he who makes haste to be rich [at any cost] shall not go unpunished. 

<sup>21</sup> 

To have respect of persons and to show partiality is not good, neither is it good that man should transgress for a piece of bread. 

<sup>22</sup> 

He who has an evil and covetous eye hastens to be rich and knows not that want will come upon him. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He who rebukes a man shall afterward find more favor than he who flatters with the tongue. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, This is no sin--he is in the same class as [an open, lawless robber and] a destroyer. 

<sup>25</sup> 

He who is of a greedy spirit stirs up strife, but he who puts his trust in the Lord shall be enriched and blessed. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He who leans on, trusts in, and is confident of his own mind and heart is a [self-confident] fool, but he who walks in skillful and godly Wisdom shall be delivered. 

<sup>27</sup> 

He who gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes [from their want] will have many a curse. 

<sup>28</sup> 

When the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves; but when they perish, the [consistently] righteous increase and become many.
