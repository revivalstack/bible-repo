The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims, and parables) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 

<sup>2</sup> 

That people may know skillful and godly Wisdom and instruction, discern and comprehend the words of understanding and insight, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Receive instruction in wise dealing and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness, righteousness, justice, and integrity, 

<sup>4</sup> 

That prudence may be given to the simple, and knowledge, discretion, and discernment to the youth-- 

<sup>5</sup> 

The wise also will hear and increase in learning, and the person of understanding will acquire skill and attain to sound counsel [so that he may be able to steer his course rightly]-- 

<sup>6</sup> 

That people may understand a proverb and a figure of speech or an enigma with its interpretation, and the words of the wise and their dark sayings or riddles. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning and the principal and choice part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence]; but fools despise skillful and godly Wisdom, instruction, and discipline. 

<sup>8</sup> 

My son, hear the instruction of your father; reject not nor forsake the teaching of your mother. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For they are a [victor's] chaplet (garland) of grace upon your head and chains and pendants [of gold worn by kings] for your neck. 

<sup>10</sup> 

My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 

<sup>11</sup> 

If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait [to shed] blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause [and show that his piety is in vain]; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Let us swallow them up alive as does Sheol (the place of the dead), and whole, as those who go down into the pit [of the dead]; 

<sup>13</sup> 

We shall find and take all kinds of precious goods [when our victims are put out of the way], we shall fill our houses with plunder; 

<sup>14</sup> 

Throw in your lot with us [they insist] and be a sworn brother and comrade; let us all have one purse in common-- 

<sup>15</sup> 

My son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path; 

<sup>16</sup> 

For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird! 

<sup>18</sup> 

But [when these men set a trap for others] they are lying in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So are the ways of everyone who is greedy of gain; such [greed for plunder] takes away the lives of its possessors. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Wisdom cries aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the markets; 

<sup>21</sup> 

She cries at the head of the noisy intersections [in the chief gathering places]; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: 

<sup>22</sup> 

How long, O simple ones [open to evil], will you love being simple? And the scoffers delight in scoffing and [self-confident] fools hate knowledge? 

<sup>23</sup> 

If you will turn (repent) and give heed to my reproof, behold, I [Wisdom] will pour out my spirit upon you, I will make my words known to you. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Because I have called and you have refused [to answer], have stretched out my hand and no man has heeded it, 

<sup>25</sup> 

And you treated as nothing all my counsel and would accept none of my reproof, 

<sup>26</sup> 

I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when the thing comes that shall cause you terror and panic-- 

<sup>27</sup> 

When your panic comes as a storm and desolation and your calamity comes on as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Then will they call upon me [Wisdom] but I will not answer; they will seek me early and diligently but they will not find me. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord, 

<sup>30</sup> 

Would accept none of my counsel, and despised all my reproof, 

<sup>31</sup> 

Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be satiated with their own devices. 

<sup>32</sup> 

For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, and the careless ease of [self-confident] fools shall destroy them. 

<sup>33</sup> 

But whoso hearkens to me [Wisdom] shall dwell securely and in confident trust and shall be quiet, without fear or dread of evil.
