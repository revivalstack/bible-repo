<sup>1</sup> 

Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is perverse in his speech and is a [self-confident] fool. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Desire without knowledge is not good, and to be overhasty is to sin and miss the mark. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The foolishness of man subverts his way [ruins his affairs]; then his heart is resentful and frets against the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Wealth makes many friends, but the poor man is avoided by his neighbor. 

<sup>5</sup> 

A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who breathes out lies shall not escape. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Many will entreat the favor of a liberal man, and every man is a friend to him who gives gifts. 

<sup>7</sup> 

All the brothers of a poor man detest him--how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues them with words, but they are gone. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He who gains Wisdom loves his own life; he who keeps understanding shall prosper and find good. 

<sup>9</sup> 

A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he who breathes forth lies shall perish. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Luxury is not fitting for a [self-confident] fool--much less for a slave to rule over princes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Good sense makes a man restrain his anger, and it is his glory to overlook a transgression or an offense. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The king's wrath is as terrifying as the roaring of a lion, but his favor is as [refreshing as] dew upon the grass. 

<sup>13</sup> 

A self-confident and foolish son is the [multiplied] calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife are like a continual dripping [of water through a chink in the roof]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

House and riches are the inheritance from fathers, but a wise, understanding, and prudent wife is from the Lord. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Slothfulness casts one into a deep sleep, and the idle person shall suffer hunger. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He who keeps the commandment [of the Lord] keeps his own life, but he who despises His ways shall die. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and that which he has given He will repay to him. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Discipline your son while there is hope, but do not [indulge your angry resentments by undue chastisements and] set yourself to his ruin. 

<sup>19</sup> 

A man of great wrath shall suffer the penalty; for if you deliver him [from the consequences], he will [feel free to] cause you to do it again. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Hear counsel, receive instruction, and accept correction, that you may be wise in the time to come. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Many plans are in a man's mind, but it is the Lord's purpose for him that will stand. 

<sup>22</sup> 

That which is desired in a man is loyalty and kindness [and his glory and delight are his giving], but a poor man is better than a liar. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The reverent, worshipful fear of the Lord leads to life, and he who has it rests satisfied; he cannot be visited with [actual] evil. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will increase in knowledge. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Cease, my son, to hear instruction only to ignore it and stray from the words of knowledge. 

<sup>28</sup> 

A worthless witness scoffs at justice, and the mouth of the wicked swallows iniquity. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Judgments are prepared for scoffers, and stripes for the backs of [self-confident] fools.
