<sup>3</sup> 

A prudent man sees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished [with suffering]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The reward of humility and the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord is riches and honor and life. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Thorns and snares are in the way of the obstinate and willful; he who guards himself will be far from them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Train up a child in the way he should go [and in keeping with his individual gift or bent], and when he is old he will not depart from it. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He who sows iniquity will reap calamity and futility, and the rod of his wrath [with which he smites others] will fail. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He who has a bountiful eye shall be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the poor. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go out; yes, strife and abuse will cease. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He who loves purity and the pure in heart and who is gracious in speech--because of the grace of his lips will he have the king for his friend. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The eyes of the Lord keep guard over knowledge and him who has it, but He overthrows the words of the treacherous. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The sluggard says, There is a lion outside! I shall be slain in the streets! 

<sup>14</sup> 

The mouth of a loose woman is a deep pit [for ensnaring wild animals]; he with whom the Lord is indignant and who is abhorrent to Him will fall into it. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He who oppresses the poor to get gain for himself and he who gives to the rich--both will surely come to want. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Listen (consent and submit) to the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my knowledge; 

<sup>18</sup> 

For it will be pleasant if you keep them in your mind [believing them]; your lips will be accustomed to [confessing] them. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So that your trust (belief, reliance, support, and confidence) may be in the Lord, I have made known these things to you today, even to you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Have I not written to you [long ago] excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 

<sup>21</sup> 

To make you know the certainty of the words of truth, that you may give a true answer to those who sent you? 

<sup>22</sup> 

Rob not the poor [being tempted by their helplessness], neither oppress the afflicted at the gate [where the city court is held], 

<sup>23</sup> 

For the Lord will plead their cause and deprive of life those who deprive [the poor or afflicted]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Make no friendships with a man given to anger, and with a wrathful man do not associate, 

<sup>25</sup> 

Lest you learn his ways and get yourself into a snare.

Be not one of those who strike hands and pledge themselves, or of those who become security for another's debts. 

<sup>27</sup>

<sup>28</sup> 

Remove not the ancient landmark which your fathers have set up. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Do you see a man diligent and skillful in his business? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
