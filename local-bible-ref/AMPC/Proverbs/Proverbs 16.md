<sup>1</sup> 

The plans of the mind and orderly thinking belong to man, but from the Lord comes the [wise] answer of the tongue. 

<sup>2</sup> 

All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits (the thoughts and intents of the heart). 

<sup>3</sup> 

Roll your works upon the Lord [commit and trust them wholly to Him; He will cause your thoughts to become agreeable to His will, and] so shall your plans be established and succeed. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The Lord has made everything [to accommodate itself and contribute] to its own end and His own purpose--even the wicked [are fitted for their role] for the day of calamity and evil. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Everyone proud and arrogant in heart is disgusting, hateful, and exceedingly offensive to the Lord; be assured [I pledge it] they will not go unpunished. 

<sup>6</sup> 

By mercy and love, truth and fidelity [to God and man--not by sacrificial offerings], iniquity is purged out of the heart, and by the reverent, worshipful fear of the Lord men depart from and avoid evil. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When a man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Better is a little with righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation and right standing with God) than great revenues with injustice. 

<sup>9</sup> 

A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps and makes them sure. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Divinely directed decisions are on the lips of the king; his mouth should not transgress in judgment. 

<sup>11</sup> 

A just balance and scales are the Lord's; all the weights of the bag are His work [established on His eternal principles]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

It is an abomination [to God and men] for kings to commit wickedness, for a throne is established and made secure by righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation). 

<sup>13</sup> 

Right and just lips are the delight of a king, and he loves him who speaks what is right. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The wrath of a king is as messengers of death, but a wise man will pacify it. 

<sup>15</sup> 

In the light of the king's countenance is life, and his favor is as a cloud bringing the spring rain. 

<sup>16</sup> 

How much better it is to get skillful and godly Wisdom than gold! And to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; he who guards his way preserves his life. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Better it is to be of a humble spirit with the meek and poor than to divide the spoil with the proud. 

<sup>20</sup> 

He who deals wisely and heeds [God's] word and counsel shall find good, and whoever leans on, trusts in, and is confident in the Lord--happy, blessed, and fortunate is he. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The wise in heart are called prudent, understanding, and knowing, and winsome speech increases learning [in both speaker and listener]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Understanding is a wellspring of life to those who have it, but to give instruction to fools is folly. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The mind of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning and persuasiveness to his lips. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, sweet to the mind and healing to the body. 

<sup>25</sup> 

There is a way that seems right to a man and appears straight before him, but at the end of it is the way of death. 

<sup>26</sup> 

The appetite of the laborer works for him, for [the need of] his mouth urges him on. 

<sup>27</sup> 

A worthless man devises and digs up mischief, and in his lips there is as a scorching fire. 

<sup>28</sup> 

A perverse man sows strife, and a whisperer separates close friends. 

<sup>29</sup> 

The exceedingly grasping, covetous, and violent man entices his neighbor, leading him in a way that is not good. 

<sup>30</sup> 

He who shuts his eyes to devise perverse things and who compresses his lips [as if in concealment] brings evil to pass. 

<sup>31</sup> 

The hoary head is a crown of beauty and glory if it is found in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation). 

<sup>32</sup> 

He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, he who rules his [own] spirit than he who takes a city. 

<sup>33</sup> 

The lot is cast into the lap, but the decision is wholly of the Lord [even the events that seem accidental are really ordered by Him].
