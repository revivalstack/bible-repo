The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as are the watercourses; He turns it whichever way He wills. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs and tries the hearts. 

<sup>3</sup> 

To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Haughtiness of eyes and a proud heart, even the tillage of the wicked or the lamp [of joy] to them [whatever it may be], are sin [in the eyes of God]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The thoughts of the [steadily] diligent tend only to plenteousness, but everyone who is impatient and hasty hastens only to want. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Securing treasures by a lying tongue is a vapor driven to and fro; those who seek them seek death. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, because they refuse to do justice. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The way of the guilty is exceedingly crooked, but as for the pure, his work is right and his conduct is straight. 

<sup>9</sup> 

It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop [on the flat oriental roof, exposed to all kinds of weather] than in a house shared with a nagging, quarrelsome, and faultfinding woman. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The soul or life of the wicked craves and seeks evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

When the scoffer is punished, the fool gets a lesson in being wise; but men of [godly] Wisdom and good sense learn by being instructed. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The [uncompromisingly] righteous man considers well the house of the wicked--how the wicked are cast down to ruin. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor will cry out himself and not be heard. 

<sup>14</sup> 

A gift in secret pacifies and turns away anger, and a bribe in the lap, strong wrath. 

<sup>15</sup> 

When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous (the upright, in right standing with God), but to the evildoers it is dismay, calamity, and ruin. 

<sup>16</sup> 

A man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall abide in the congregation of the spirits (of the dead). 

<sup>17</sup> 

He who loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The wicked become a ransom for the [uncompromisingly] righteous, and the treacherous for the upright [because the wicked themselves fall into the traps and pits they have dug for the good]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

It is better to dwell in a desert land than with a contentious woman and with vexation. 

<sup>20</sup> 

There are precious treasures and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a self-confident and foolish man swallows it up and wastes it. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He who earnestly seeks after and craves righteousness, mercy, and loving-kindness will find life in addition to righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God) and honor. 

<sup>22</sup> 

A wise man scales the city walls of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from troubles. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The proud and haughty man--Scoffer is his name--deals and acts with overbearing pride. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The desire of the slothful kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He covets greedily all the day long, but the [uncompromisingly] righteous gives and does not withhold. 

<sup>27</sup> 

The sacrifice of the wicked is exceedingly disgusting and abhorrent [to the Lord]--how much more when he brings it with evil intention? 

<sup>28</sup> 

A false witness will perish, but the word of a man who hears attentively will endure and go unchallenged. 

<sup>29</sup> 

A wicked man puts on the bold, unfeeling face [of guilt], but as for the upright, he considers, directs, and establishes his way [with the confidence of integrity]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

There is no [human] wisdom or understanding or counsel [that can prevail] against the Lord. 

<sup>31</sup> 

The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but deliverance and victory are of the Lord.
