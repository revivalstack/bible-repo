<sup>1</sup> 

Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, and pay attention in order to gain and to know intelligent discernment, comprehension, and interpretation [of spiritual matters]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For I give you good doctrine [what is to be received]; do not forsake my teaching. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When I [Solomon] was a son with my father [David], tender and the only son in the sight of my mother [Bathsheba], 

<sup>4</sup> 

He taught me and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments and live. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Get skillful and godly Wisdom, get understanding (discernment, comprehension, and interpretation); do not forget and do not turn back from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Forsake not [Wisdom], and she will keep, defend, and protect you; love her, and she will guard you. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The beginning of Wisdom is: get Wisdom (skillful and godly Wisdom)! [For skillful and godly Wisdom is the principal thing.] And with all you have gotten, get understanding (discernment, comprehension, and interpretation). 

<sup>8</sup> 

Prize Wisdom highly and exalt her, and she will exalt and promote you; she will bring you to honor when you embrace her. 

<sup>9</sup> 

She shall give to your head a wreath of gracefulness; a crown of beauty and glory will she deliver to you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of your life shall be many. 

<sup>11</sup> 

I have taught you in the way of skillful and godly Wisdom [which is comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of God]; I have led you in paths of uprightness. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When you walk, your steps shall not be hampered [your path will be clear and open]; and when you run, you shall not stumble. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Avoid it, do not go on it; turn from it and pass on. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For they cannot sleep unless they have caused trouble or vexation; their sleep is taken away unless they have caused someone to fall. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But the path of the [uncompromisingly] just and righteous is like the light of dawn, that shines more and more (brighter and clearer) until [it reaches its full strength and glory in] the perfect day [to be prepared]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. 

<sup>20</sup> 

My son, attend to my words; consent and submit to my sayings. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Let them not depart from your sight; keep them in the center of your heart. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For they are life to those who find them, healing and health to all their flesh. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Keep and guard your heart with all vigilance and above all that you guard, for out of it flow the springs of life. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Put away from you false and dishonest speech, and willful and contrary talk put far from you. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Let your eyes look right on [with fixed purpose], and let your gaze be straight before you. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Consider well the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established and ordered aright. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Turn not aside to the right hand or to the left; remove your foot from evil.
