<sup>1</sup> 

My son, if you will receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Making your ear attentive to skillful and godly Wisdom and inclining and directing your heart and mind to understanding [applying all your powers to the quest for it]; 

<sup>3</sup> 

Yes, if you cry out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, 

<sup>4</sup> 

If you seek [Wisdom] as for silver and search for skillful and godly Wisdom as for hidden treasures, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then you will understand the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of [our omniscient] God. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For the Lord gives skillful and godly Wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He hides away sound and godly Wisdom and stores it for the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with Him); He is a shield to those who walk uprightly and in integrity, 

<sup>8</sup> 

That He may guard the paths of justice; yes, He preserves the way of His saints. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then you will understand righteousness, justice, and fair dealing [in every area and relation]; yes, you will understand every good path. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For skillful and godly Wisdom shall enter into your heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to you. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Discretion shall watch over you, understanding shall keep you, 

<sup>12</sup> 

To deliver you from the way of evil and the evil men, from men who speak perverse things and are liars, 

<sup>13</sup> 

Men who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Who rejoice to do evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Who are crooked in their ways, wayward and devious in their paths. 

<sup>16</sup> 

[Discretion shall watch over you, understanding shall keep you] to deliver you from the alien woman, from the outsider with her flattering words, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Who forsakes the husband and guide of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For her house sinks down to death and her paths to the spirits [of the dead]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

None who go to her return again, neither do they attain or regain the paths of life. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So may you walk in the way of good men, and keep to the paths of the [consistently] righteous (the upright, in right standing with God). 

<sup>21</sup> 

For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the men of integrity, blameless and complete [in God's sight], shall remain in it; 

<sup>22</sup> 

But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
