<sup>1</sup> 

My son, be attentive to my Wisdom [godly Wisdom learned by actual and costly experience], and incline your ear to my understanding [of what is becoming and prudent for you], 

<sup>2</sup> 

That you may exercise proper discrimination and discretion and your lips may guard and keep knowledge and the wise answer [to temptation]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For the lips of a loose woman drip honey as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil; 

<sup>4</sup> 

But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged and devouring sword. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold of Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead). 

<sup>6</sup> 

She loses sight of and walks not in the path of life; her ways wind about aimlessly, and you cannot know them. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let your way in life be far from her, and come not near the door of her house [avoid the very scenes of temptation], 

<sup>9</sup> 

Lest you give your honor to others and your years to those without mercy, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Lest strangers [and false teachings] take their fill of your strength and wealth and your labors go to the house of an alien [from God]-- 

<sup>11</sup> 

And you groan and mourn when your end comes, when your flesh and body are consumed, 

<sup>12</sup> 

And you say, How I hated instruction and discipline, and my heart despised reproof! 

<sup>13</sup> 

I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor submitted and consented to those who instructed me. 

<sup>14</sup> 

[The extent and boldness of] my sin involved almost all evil [in the estimation] of the congregation and the community. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Drink waters out of your own cistern [of a pure marriage relationship], and fresh running waters out of your own well. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Should your offspring be dispersed abroad as water brooks in the streets? 

<sup>17</sup> 

[Confine yourself to your own wife] let your children be for you alone, and not the children of strangers with you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Let your fountain [of human life] be blessed [with the rewards of fidelity], and rejoice in the wife of your youth. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant doe [tender, gentle, attractive]--let her bosom satisfy you at all times, and always be transported with delight in her love. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Why should you, my son, be infatuated with a loose woman, embrace the bosom of an outsider, and go astray? 

<sup>21</sup> 

For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the Lord, and He [Who would have us live soberly, chastely, and godly] carefully weighs all man's goings. 

<sup>22</sup> 

His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked man, and he shall be held with the cords of his sin. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He will die for lack of discipline and instruction, and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray and be lost.
