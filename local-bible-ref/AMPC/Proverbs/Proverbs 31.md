The words of Lemuel king of Massa, which his mother taught him: 

<sup>2</sup> 

What, my son? What, son of my womb? What [shall I advise you], son of my vows and dedication to God? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Give not your strength to [loose] women, nor your ways to those who and that which ruin and destroy kings. 

<sup>4</sup> 

It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to desire strong drink, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Lest they drink and forget the law and what it decrees, and pervert the justice due any of the afflicted. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Give strong drink [as medicine] to him who is ready to pass away, and wine to him in bitter distress of heart. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let him drink and forget his poverty and [seriously] remember his want and misery no more. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Open your mouth for the dumb [those unable to speak for themselves], for the rights of all who are left desolate and defenseless; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Open your mouth, judge righteously, and administer justice for the poor and needy. 

<sup>10</sup> 

A capable, intelligent, and virtuous woman--who is he who can find her? She is far more precious than jewels and her value is far above rubies or pearls. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The heart of her husband trusts in her confidently and relies on and believes in her securely, so that he has no lack of [honest] gain or need of [dishonest] spoil. 

<sup>12</sup> 

She comforts, encourages, and does him only good as long as there is life within her. 

<sup>13</sup> 

She seeks out wool and flax and works with willing hands [to develop it]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

She is like the merchant ships loaded with foodstuffs; she brings her household's food from a far [country]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

She rises while it is yet night and gets [spiritual] food for her household and assigns her maids their tasks. 

<sup>16</sup> 

She considers a [new] field before she buys or accepts it [expanding prudently and not courting neglect of her present duties by assuming other duties]; with her savings [of time and strength] she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard. 

<sup>17</sup> 

She girds herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task] and makes her arms strong and firm. 

<sup>18</sup> 

She tastes and sees that her gain from work [with and for God] is good; her lamp goes not out, but it burns on continually through the night [of trouble, privation, or sorrow, warning away fear, doubt, and distrust]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 

<sup>20</sup> 

She opens her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her filled hands to the needy [whether in body, mind, or spirit]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

She fears not the snow for her family, for all her household are doubly clothed in scarlet. 

<sup>22</sup> 

She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, and rugs of tapestry. Her clothing is of linen, pure and fine, and of purple [such as that of which the clothing of the priests and the hallowed cloths of the temple were made]. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Her husband is known in the [city's] gates, when he sits among the elders of the land. 

<sup>24</sup> 

She makes fine linen garments and leads others to buy them; she delivers to the merchants girdles [or sashes that free one up for service]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Strength and dignity are her clothing and her position is strong and secure; she rejoices over the future [the latter day or time to come, knowing that she and her family are in readiness for it]! 

<sup>26</sup> 

She opens her mouth in skillful and godly Wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness [giving counsel and instruction]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

She looks well to how things go in her household, and the bread of idleness (gossip, discontent, and self-pity) she will not eat. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, fortunate, and to be envied); and her husband boasts of and praises her, [saying], 

<sup>29</sup> 

Many daughters have done virtuously, nobly, and well [with the strength of character that is steadfast in goodness], but you excel them all. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Charm and grace are deceptive, and beauty is vain [because it is not lasting], but a woman who reverently and worshipfully fears the Lord, she shall be praised! 

<sup>31</sup> 

Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates [of the city]!
