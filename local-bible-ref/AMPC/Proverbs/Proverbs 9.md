Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out and set up her seven [perfect number of] pillars. 

<sup>2</sup> 

She has killed her beasts, she has mixed her [spiritual] wine; she has also set her table. 

<sup>3</sup> 

She has sent out her maids to cry from the highest places of the town: 

<sup>4</sup> 

Whoever is simple (easily led astray and wavering), let him turn in here! As for him who lacks understanding, [God's] Wisdom says to him, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Come, eat of my bread and drink of the [spiritual] wine which I have mixed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Leave off, simple ones [forsake the foolish and simpleminded] and live! And walk in the way of insight and understanding. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He who rebukes a scorner heaps upon himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man gets for himself bruises. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man (one upright and in right standing with God) and he will increase in learning. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord is the beginning (the chief and choice part) of Wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight and understanding. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For by me [Wisdom from God] your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased. 

<sup>12</sup> 

If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scorn, you alone will bear it and pay the penalty. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The foolish woman is noisy; she is simple and open to all forms of evil, she [willfully and recklessly] knows nothing whatever [of eternal value]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For she sits at the door of her house or on a seat in the conspicuous places of the town, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Calling to those who pass by, who go uprightly on their way: 

<sup>16</sup> 

Whoever is simple (wavering and easily led astray), let him turn in here! And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Stolen waters (pleasures) are sweet [because they are forbidden]; and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But he knows not that the shades of the dead are there [specters haunting the scene of past transgressions], and that her invited guests are [already sunk] in the depths of Sheol (the lower world, Hades, the place of the dead).
