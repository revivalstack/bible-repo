My son, keep my words; lay up within you my commandments [for use when needed] and treasure them. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Keep my commandments and live, and keep my law and teaching as the apple (the pupil) of your eye. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Say to skillful and godly Wisdom, You are my sister, and regard understanding or insight as your intimate friend-- 

<sup>5</sup> 

That they may keep you from the loose woman, from the adventuress who flatters with and makes smooth her words. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And among the simple (empty-headed and emptyhearted) ones, I perceived among the youths a young man void of good sense, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Sauntering through the street near the [loose woman's] corner; and he went the way to her house 

<sup>9</sup> 

In the twilight, in the evening; night black and dense was falling [over the young man's life]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And behold, there met him a woman, dressed as a harlot and sly and cunning of heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 

She is turbulent and willful; her feet stay not in her house; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Now in the streets, now in the marketplaces, she sets her ambush at every corner. 

<sup>13</sup> 

So she caught him and kissed him and with impudent face she said to him, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Sacrifices of peace offerings were due from me; this day I paid my vows. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So I came forth to meet you [that you might share with me the feast from my offering]; diligently I sought your face, and I have found you. 

<sup>16</sup> 

I have spread my couch with rugs and cushions of tapestry, with striped sheets of fine linen of Egypt. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Come, let us take our fill of love until morning; let us console and delight ourselves with love. 

<sup>19</sup> 

For the man is not at home; he is gone on a long journey; 

<sup>20</sup> 

He has taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed [at the full moon]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

With much justifying and enticing argument she persuades him, with the allurements of her lips she leads him [to overcome his conscience and his fears] and forces him along. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Suddenly he [yields and] follows her reluctantly like an ox moving to the slaughter, like one in fetters going to the correction [to be given] to a fool or like a dog enticed by food to the muzzle 

<sup>23</sup> 

Till a dart [of passion] pierces and inflames his vitals; then like a bird fluttering straight into the net [he hastens], not knowing that it will cost him his life. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Listen to me now therefore, O you sons, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Let not your heart incline toward her ways, do not stray into her paths. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For she has cast down many wounded; indeed, all her slain are a mighty host. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Her house is the way to Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead), going down to the chambers of death.
