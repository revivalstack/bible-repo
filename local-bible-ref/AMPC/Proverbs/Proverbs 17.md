Fine or arrogant speech does not befit [an empty-headed] fool--much less do lying lips befit a prince. 

<sup>8</sup> 

A bribe is like a bright, precious stone that dazzles the eyes and affects the mind of him who gives it; [as if by magic] he prospers, whichever way he turns. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He who covers and forgives an offense seeks love, but he who repeats or harps on a matter separates even close friends.

He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both an abomination [exceedingly disgusting and hateful] to the Lord.
