<sup>1</sup> 

My son, if you have become security for your neighbor, if you have given your pledge for a stranger or another, 

<sup>2</sup> 

You are snared with the words of your lips, you are caught by the speech of your mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Do this now [at once and earnestly], my son, and deliver yourself when you have put yourself into the power of your neighbor; go, bestir and humble yourself, and beg your neighbor [to pay his debt and thereby release you]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Give not [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids; 

<sup>5</sup> 

Deliver yourself, as a roe or gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways and be wise!-- 

<sup>7</sup> 

Which, having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Provides her food in the summer and gathers her supplies in the harvest. 

<sup>9</sup> 

How long will you sleep, O sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down and sleep-- 

<sup>11</sup> 

So will your poverty come like a robber or one who travels [with slowly but surely approaching steps] and your want like an armed man [making you helpless]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

A worthless person, a wicked man, is he who goes about with a perverse (contrary, wayward) mouth. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He winks with his eyes, he speaks by shuffling or tapping with his feet, he makes signs [to mislead and deceive] and teaches with his fingers. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Willful and contrary in his heart, he devises trouble, vexation, and evil continually; he lets loose discord and sows it. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Therefore upon him shall the crushing weight of calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken, and that without remedy. 

<sup>16</sup> 

These six things the Lord hates, indeed, seven are an abomination to Him: 

<sup>17</sup> 

A proud look [the spirit that makes one overestimate himself and underestimate others], a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 

<sup>18</sup> 

A heart that manufactures wicked thoughts and plans, feet that are swift in running to evil, 

<sup>19</sup> 

A false witness who breathes out lies [even under oath], and he who sows discord among his brethren. 

<sup>20</sup> 

My son, keep your father's [God-given] commandment and forsake not the law of [God] your mother [taught you]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Bind them continually upon your heart and tie them about your neck. 

<sup>22</sup> 

When you go, they [the words of your parents' God] shall lead you; when you sleep, they shall keep you; and when you waken, they shall talk with you. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For the commandment is a lamp, and the whole teaching [of the law] is light, and reproofs of discipline are the way of life, 

<sup>24</sup> 

To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a loose woman. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Lust not after her beauty in your heart, neither let her capture you with her eyelids. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread, and the adulteress stalks and snares [as with a hook] the precious life [of a man]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned? 

<sup>28</sup> 

Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned? 

<sup>29</sup> 

So he who cohabits with his neighbor's wife [will be tortured with evil consequences and just retribution]; he who touches her shall not be innocent or go unpunished. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry; 

<sup>31</sup> 

But if he is found out, he must restore seven times [what he stole]; he must give the whole substance of his house [if necessary--to meet his fine]. 

<sup>32</sup> 

But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks heart and understanding (moral principle and prudence); he who does it is destroying his own life. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Wounds and disgrace will he get, and his reproach will not be wiped away. 

<sup>34</sup> 

For jealousy makes [the wronged] man furious; therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance [upon the detected one]. 

<sup>35</sup> 

He will not consider any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment]; neither will he be satisfied, though you offer him many gifts and bribes.
