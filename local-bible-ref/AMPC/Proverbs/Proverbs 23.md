<sup>1</sup> 

When you sit down to eat with a ruler, consider who and what are before you; 

<sup>2</sup> 

For you will put a knife to your throat if you are a man given to desire. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Be not desirous of his dainties, for it is deceitful food [offered with questionable motives]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Weary not yourself to be rich; cease from your own [human] wisdom. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Will you set your eyes upon wealth, when [suddenly] it is gone? For riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flies toward the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Eat not the bread of him who has a hard, grudging, and envious eye, neither desire his dainty foods; 

<sup>7</sup> 

For as he thinks in his heart, so is he. As one who reckons, he says to you, eat and drink, yet his heart is not with you [but is grudging the cost]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The morsel which you have eaten you will vomit up, and your complimentary words will be wasted. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Speak not in the ears of a [self-confident] fool, for he will despise the [godly] Wisdom of your words. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Remove not the ancient landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless, 

<sup>11</sup> 

For their Redeemer is mighty; He will plead their cause against you. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Apply your mind to instruction and correction and your ears to words of knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Withhold not discipline from the child; for if you strike and punish him with the [reedlike] rod, he will not die. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall whip him with the rod and deliver his life from Sheol (Hades, the place of the dead). 

<sup>15</sup> 

My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine; 

<sup>16</sup> 

Yes, my heart will rejoice when your lips speak right things. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the reverent and worshipful fear of the Lord all the day long. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For surely there is a latter end [a future and a reward], and your hope and expectation shall not be cut off. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your mind in the way [of the Lord]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Do not associate with winebibbers; be not among them nor among gluttonous eaters of meat, 

<sup>21</sup> 

For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Hearken to your father, who begot you, and despise not your mother when she is old. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Buy the truth and sell it not; not only that, but also get discernment and judgment, instruction and understanding. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The father of the [uncompromisingly] righteous (the upright, in right standing with God) shall greatly rejoice, and he who becomes the father of a wise child shall have joy in him. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her who bore you rejoice. 

<sup>26</sup> 

My son, give me your heart and let your eyes observe and delight in my ways, 

<sup>27</sup> 

For a harlot is a deep ditch, and a loose woman is a narrow pit. 

<sup>28</sup> 

She also lies in wait as a robber or as one waits for prey, and she increases the treacherous among men. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness and dimness of eyes? 

<sup>30</sup> 

Those who tarry long at the wine, those who go to seek and try mixed wine. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the wineglass, when it goes down smoothly. 

<sup>32</sup> 

At the last it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. 

<sup>33</sup> 

[Under the influence of wine] your eyes will behold strange things [and loose women] and your mind will utter things turned the wrong way [untrue, incorrect, and petulant]. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Yes, you will be [as unsteady] as he who lies down in the midst of the sea, and [as open to disaster] as he who lies upon the top of a mast. 

<sup>35</sup> 

You will say, They struck me, but I was not hurt! They beat me [as with a hammer], but I did not feel it! When shall I awake? I will crave and seek more wine again [and escape reality].
