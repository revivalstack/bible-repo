<sup>1</sup> 

Does not skillful and godly Wisdom cry out, and understanding raise her voice [in contrast to the loose woman]? 

<sup>2</sup> 

On the top of the heights beside the way, where the paths meet, stands Wisdom [skillful and godly]; 

<sup>3</sup> 

At the gates at the entrance of the town, at the coming in at the doors, she cries out: 

<sup>4</sup> 

To you, O men, I call, and my voice is directed to the sons of men. 

<sup>5</sup> 

O you simple and thoughtless ones, understand prudence; you [self-confident] fools, be of an understanding heart. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Hear, for I will speak excellent and princely things; and the opening of my lips shall be for right things. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For my mouth shall utter truth, and wrongdoing is detestable and loathsome to my lips. 

<sup>8</sup> 

All the words of my mouth are righteous (upright and in right standing with God); there is nothing contrary to truth or crooked in them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

They are all plain to him who understands [and opens his heart], and right to those who find knowledge [and live by it]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Receive my instruction in preference to [striving for] silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, 

<sup>11</sup> 

For skillful and godly Wisdom is better than rubies or pearls, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I, Wisdom [from God], make prudence my dwelling, and I find out knowledge and discretion. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The reverent fear and worshipful awe of the Lord [includes] the hatred of evil; pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted and twisted speech I hate. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I have counsel and sound knowledge, I have understanding, I have might and power. 

<sup>15</sup> 

By me kings reign and rulers decree justice. 

<sup>16</sup> 

By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges and governors of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I love those who love me, and those who seek me early and diligently shall find me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness (uprightness in every area and relation, and right standing with God). 

<sup>19</sup> 

My fruit is better than gold, yes, than refined gold, and my increase than choice silver. 

<sup>20</sup> 

I [Wisdom] walk in the way of righteousness (moral and spiritual rectitude in every area and relation), in the midst of the paths of justice, 

<sup>21</sup> 

That I may cause those who love me to inherit [true] riches and that I may fill their treasuries. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The Lord formed and brought me [Wisdom] forth at the beginning of His way, before His acts of old. 

<sup>23</sup> 

I [Wisdom] was inaugurated and ordained from everlasting, from the beginning, before ever the earth existed. 

<sup>24</sup> 

When there were no deeps, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains laden with water. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth, 

<sup>26</sup> 

While as yet He had not made the land or the fields or the first of the dust of the earth. 

<sup>27</sup> 

When He prepared the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there; when He drew a circle upon the face of the deep and stretched out the firmament over it, 

<sup>28</sup> 

When He made firm the skies above, when He established the fountains of the deep, 

<sup>29</sup> 

When He gave to the sea its limit and His decree that the waters should not transgress [across the boundaries set by] His command, when He appointed the foundations of the earth-- 

<sup>30</sup> 

Then I [Wisdom] was beside Him as a master and director of the work; and I was daily His delight, rejoicing before Him always, 

<sup>31</sup> 

Rejoicing in His inhabited earth and delighting in the sons of men. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Now therefore listen to me, O you sons; for blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are those who keep my ways. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Hear instruction and be wise, and do not refuse or neglect it. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 

<sup>35</sup> 

For whoever finds me [Wisdom] finds life and draws forth and obtains favor from the Lord. 

<sup>36</sup> 

But he who misses me or sins against me wrongs and injures himself; all who hate me love and court death.
