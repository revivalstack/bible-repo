And when the Sabbath was past [that is, after the sun had set], Mary Magdalene, and Mary [the mother] of James, and Salome purchased sweet-smelling spices, so that they might go and anoint [Jesus' body]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And very early on the first day of the week they came to the tomb; [by then] the sun had risen. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they said to one another, Who will roll back the stone for us out of [the groove across the floor at] the door of the tomb? 

<sup>4</sup> 

And when they looked up, they [distinctly] saw that the stone was already rolled back, for it was very large. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And going into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting [there] on the right [side], clothed in a [long, stately, sweeping] robe of white, and they were utterly amazed and struck with terror. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And he said to them, Do not be amazed and terrified; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, Who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But be going; tell the disciples and Peter, He goes before you into Galilee; you will see Him there, [just] as He told you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then they went out [and] fled from the tomb, for trembling and bewilderment and consternation had seized them. And they said nothing about it to anyone, for they were held by alarm and fear. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Now Jesus, having risen [from death] early on the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had driven out seven demons. 

<sup>10</sup> 

She went and reported it to those who had been with Him, as they grieved and wept. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And when they heard that He was alive and that she had seen Him, they did not believe it. 

<sup>12</sup> 

After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking [along the way] into the country. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And they returned [to Jerusalem] and told the others, but they did not believe them either. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Afterward He appeared to the Eleven [apostles themselves] as they reclined at table; and He reproved and reproached them for their unbelief (their lack of faith) and their hardness of heart, because they had refused to believe those who had seen Him and looked at Him attentively after He had risen [from death]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach and publish openly the good news (the Gospel) to every creature [of the whole human race]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He who believes [who adheres to and trusts in and relies on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] and is baptized will be saved [from the penalty of eternal death]; but he who does not believe [who does not adhere to and trust in and rely on the Gospel and Him Whom it sets forth] will be condemned. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And these attesting signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; 

<sup>18</sup> 

They will pick up serpents; and [even] if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will get well. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So then the Lord Jesus, after He had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and He sat down at the right hand of God. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the attesting signs and miracles that closely accompanied [it]. Amen (so be it).
