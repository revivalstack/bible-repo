<sup>1</sup> 

And immediately when it was morning, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole council, held a consultation; and when they had bound Jesus, they took Him away [violently] and handed Him over to Pilate. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Pilate inquired of Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And He replied, It is as you say. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And the chief priests kept accusing Him of many things. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Pilate again asked Him, Have You no answer to make? See how many charges they are bringing against You! 

<sup>5</sup> 

But Jesus made no further answer at all, so that Pilate wondered and marveled. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Now at the Feast he [was accustomed to] set free for them any one prisoner whom they requested. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And among the rioters in the prison who had committed murder in the insurrection there was a man named Barabbas. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the throng came up and began asking Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And he replied to them, Do you wish me to set free for you the King of the Jews? 

<sup>10</sup> 

For he was aware that it was [because they were prompted] by envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release for them Barabbas instead. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And again Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with the Man Whom you call the King of the Jews? 

<sup>13</sup> 

And they shouted back again, Crucify Him! 

<sup>14</sup> 

But Pilate said to them, Why? What has He done that is evil? But they shouted with all their might all the more, Crucify Him [at once]! 

<sup>15</sup> 

So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, set Barabbas free for them; and after having Jesus whipped, he handed [Him] over to be crucified. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Then the soldiers led Him away to the courtyard inside the palace, that is, the Praetorium, and they called the entire detachment of soldiers together. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And they dressed Him in [a] purple [robe], and, weaving together a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And they began to salute Him, Hail (greetings, good health to You, long life to You), King of the Jews! 

<sup>19</sup> 

And they struck His head with a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and spat on Him and kept bowing their knees in homage to Him. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And when they had [finished] making sport of Him, they took the purple [robe] off of Him and put His own clothes on Him. And they led Him out [of the city] to crucify Him. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And they forced a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who was coming in from the field (country), to carry His cross. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And they led Him to Golgotha [in Latin: Calvary], meaning The Place of a Skull. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And they [attempted to] give Him wine mingled with myrrh, but He would not take it. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And they crucified Him; and they divided His garments and distributed them among themselves, throwing lots for them to decide who should take what. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And it was the third hour (about nine o'clock in the morning) when they crucified Him. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And the inscription of the accusation against Him was written above, The King of the Jews. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on [His] right hand and one on His left. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, He was counted among the transgressors. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And those who passed by kept reviling Him and reproaching Him abusively in harsh and insolent language, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You Who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, 

<sup>30</sup> 

Now rescue Yourself [from death], coming down from the cross! 

<sup>31</sup> 

So also the chief priests, with the scribes, made sport of Him to one another, saying, He rescued others [from death]; Himself He is unable to rescue. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Let the Christ (the Messiah), the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see [it] and trust in and rely on Him and adhere to Him! Those who were crucified with Him also reviled and reproached Him [speaking abusively, harshly, and insolently]. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And when the sixth hour (about midday) had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour (about three o'clock). 

<sup>34</sup> 

And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?--which means, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me [deserting Me and leaving Me helpless and abandoned]? 

<sup>35</sup> 

And some of those standing by, [and] hearing it, said, See! He is calling Elijah! 

<sup>36</sup> 

And one man ran, and, filling a sponge with vinegar (a mixture of sour wine and water), put it on a staff made of a [bamboo-like] reed and gave it to Him to drink, saying, Hold off! Let us see whether Elijah [does] come to take Him down. 

<sup>37</sup> 

And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed out His life. 

<sup>38</sup> 

And the curtain [of the Holy of Holies] of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 

<sup>39</sup> 

And when the centurion who stood facing Him saw Him expire this way, he said, Really, this Man was God's Son! 

<sup>40</sup> 

Now some women were there also, looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, 

<sup>41</sup> 

Who, when [Jesus] was in Galilee, were in the habit of accompanying and ministering to Him; and [there were] also many other [women] who had come up with Him to Jerusalem. 

<sup>42</sup> 

As evening had already come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, [the day] before the Sabbath, 

<sup>43</sup> 

Joseph, he of Arimathea, noble and honorable in rank and a respected member of the council (Sanhedrin), who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, daring the consequences, took courage and ventured to go to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 

<sup>44</sup> 

But Pilate wondered whether He was dead so soon, and, having called the centurion, he asked him whether [Jesus] was already dead. 

<sup>45</sup> 

And when he learned from the centurion [that He was indeed dead], he gave the body to Joseph. 

<sup>46</sup> 

And Joseph bought a [fine] linen cloth [for swathing dead bodies], and, taking Him down from the cross, he rolled Him up in the [fine] linen cloth and placed Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock. Then he rolled a [very large] stone against the door of the tomb. 

<sup>47</sup> 

And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were [attentively] observing where He was laid.
