<sup>1</sup> 

In those days when [again] an immense crowd had gathered and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and told them, 

<sup>2</sup> 

I have pity and sympathy for the people and My heart goes out to them, for they have been with Me now three days and have nothing [left] to eat; 

<sup>3</sup> 

And if I send them away to their homes hungry, they will be feeble through exhaustion and faint along the road; and some of them have come a long way. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And His disciples replied to Him, How can anyone fill and satisfy [these people] with loaves of bread here in [this] desolate and uninhabited region? 

<sup>5</sup> 

And He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And He commanded the multitude to recline upon the ground, and He [then] took the seven loaves [of bread] and, having given thanks, He broke them and kept on giving them to His disciples to put before [the people], and they placed them before the crowd. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And they had a few small fish; and when He had praised God and given thanks and asked Him to bless them [to their use], He ordered that these also should be set before [them]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And they ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven [large provision] baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And there were about 4,000 people. And He dismissed them, 

<sup>10</sup> 

And at once He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha (or Magdala). 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Pharisees came and began to argue with and question Him, demanding from Him a sign (an attesting miracle from heaven) [maliciously] to test Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And He groaned and sighed deeply in His spirit and said, Why does this generation demand a sign? Positively I say to you, no sign shall be given this generation. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And He went away and left them and, getting into the boat again, He departed to the other side. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Now they had [completely] forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And Jesus [repeatedly and expressly] charged and admonished them, saying, Look out; keep on your guard and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod and the Herodians. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And they discussed it and reasoned with one another, It is because we have no bread. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And being aware [of it], Jesus said to them, Why are you reasoning and saying it is because you have no bread? Do you not yet discern or understand? Are your hearts in [a settled state of] hardness? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Having eyes, do you not see [with them], and having ears, do you not hear and perceive and understand the sense of what is said? And do you not remember? 

<sup>19</sup> 

When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many [small hand] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And [when I broke] the seven loaves for the 4,000, how many [large provision] baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to Him, Seven. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And He kept repeating, Do you not yet understand? 

<sup>22</sup> 

And they came to Bethsaida. And [people] brought to Him a blind man and begged Him to touch him. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And He caught the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village; and when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands upon him, He asked him, Do you [possibly] see anything? 

<sup>24</sup> 

And he looked up and said, I see people, but [they look] like trees, walking. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Then He put His hands on his eyes again; and the man looked intently [that is, fixed his eyes on definite objects], and he was restored and saw everything distinctly [even what was at a distance]. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And He sent him away to his house, telling [him], Do not [even] enter the village or tell anyone there. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And Jesus went on with His disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He asked His disciples, Who do people say that I am? 

<sup>28</sup> 

And they answered [Him], John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And He asked them, But who do you yourselves say that I am? Peter replied to Him, You are the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 

<sup>30</sup> 

And He charged them sharply to tell no one about Him. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must of necessity suffer many things and be tested and disapproved and rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be put to death, and after three days rise again [from death]. 

<sup>32</sup> 

And He said this freely (frankly, plainly, and explicitly, making it unmistakable). And Peter took Him by the hand and led Him aside and then [facing Him] began to rebuke Him. 

<sup>33</sup> 

But turning around [His back to Peter] and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind Me, Satan! For you do not have a mind intent on promoting what God wills, but what pleases men [you are not on God's side, but that of men]. 

<sup>34</sup> 

And Jesus called [to Him] the throng with His disciples and said to them, If anyone intends to come after Me, let him deny himself [forget, ignore, disown, and lose sight of himself and his own interests] and take up his cross, and [joining Me as a disciple and siding with My party] follow with Me [continually, cleaving steadfastly to Me]. 

<sup>35</sup> 

For whoever wants to save his [higher, spiritual, eternal] life, will lose it [the lower, natural, temporal life which is lived only on earth]; and whoever gives up his life [which is lived only on earth] for My sake and the Gospel's will save it [his higher, spiritual life in the eternal kingdom of God]. 

<sup>36</sup> 

For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life [in the eternal kingdom of God]? 

<sup>37</sup> 

For what can a man give as an exchange (a compensation, a ransom, in return) for his [blessed] life [in the eternal kingdom of God]? 

<sup>38</sup> 

For whoever is ashamed [here and now] of Me and My words in this adulterous (unfaithful) and [preeminently] sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when He comes in the glory (splendor and majesty) of His Father with the holy angels.
