First of all, then, I admonish and urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men, 

<sup>2</sup> 

For kings and all who are in positions of authority or high responsibility, that [outwardly] we may pass a quiet and undisturbed life [and inwardly] a peaceable one in all godliness and reverence and seriousness in every way. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For such [praying] is good and right, and [it is] pleasing and acceptable to God our Savior, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who wishes all men to be saved and [increasingly] to perceive and recognize and discern and know precisely and correctly the [divine] Truth. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For there [is only] one God, and [only] one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Who gave Himself as a ransom for all [people, a fact that was] attested to at the right and proper time. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And of this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (special messenger)--I am speaking the truth in Christ, I do not falsify [when I say this]--a teacher of the Gentiles in [the realm of] faith and truth. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I desire therefore that in every place men should pray, without anger or quarreling or resentment or doubt [in their minds], lifting up holy hands. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Also [I desire] that women should adorn themselves modestly and appropriately and sensibly in seemly apparel, not with [elaborate] hair arrangement or gold or pearls or expensive clothing, 

<sup>10</sup> 

But by doing good deeds (deeds in themselves good and for the good and advantage of those contacted by them), as befits women who profess reverential fear for and devotion to God. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let a woman learn in quietness, in entire submissiveness. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I allow no woman to teach or to have authority over men; she is to remain in quietness and keep silence [in religious assemblies]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For Adam was first formed, then Eve; 

<sup>14</sup> 

And it was not Adam who was deceived, but [the] woman who was deceived and deluded and fell into transgression. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Nevertheless [the sentence put upon women of pain in motherhood does not hinder their souls' salvation, and] they will be saved [eternally] if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control, [saved indeed] through the Childbearing or by the birth of the divine Child.
