How fair you are, my love [he said], how very fair! Your eyes behind your veil [remind me] of those of a dove; your hair [makes me think of the black, wavy fleece] of a flock of [the Arabian] goats which one sees trailing down Mount Gilead [beyond the Jordan on the frontiers of the desert]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Your teeth are like a flock of shorn ewes which have come up from the washing, of which all are in pairs, and none is missing among them. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your neck is like the tower of David, built for an arsenal, whereon hang a thousand bucklers, all of them shields of warriors. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your two breasts are like two fawns, like twins of a gazelle that feed among the lilies. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, [in my thoughts] I will get to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense [to him whom my soul adores]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

[He exclaimed] O my love, how beautiful you are! There is no flaw in you! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Come away with me from Lebanon, my [promised] bride, come with me from Lebanon. Depart from the top of Amana, from the peak of Senir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You have ravished my heart and given me courage, my sister, my [promised] bride; you have ravished my heart and given me courage with one look from your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace. 

<sup>10</sup> 

How beautiful is your love, my sister, my [promised] bride! How much better is your love than wine! And the fragrance of your ointments than all spices! 

<sup>11</sup> 

Your lips, O my [promised] bride, drop honey as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under your tongue. And the odor of your garments is like the odor of Lebanon. 

<sup>12</sup> 

A garden enclosed and barred is my sister, my [promised] bride--a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates or a paradise with precious fruits, henna with spikenard plants, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense, myrrh, and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

<sup>15</sup> 

You are a fountain [springing up] in a garden, a well of living waters, and flowing streams from Lebanon. 

<sup>16</sup> 

[You have called me a garden, she said] Oh, I pray that the [cold] north wind and the [soft] south wind may blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out [in abundance for you in whom my soul delights]. Let my beloved come into his garden and eat its choicest fruits.
