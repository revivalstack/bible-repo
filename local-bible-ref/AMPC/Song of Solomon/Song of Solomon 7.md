[Then her companions began noticing and commenting on the attractiveness of her person] How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O queenly maiden! Your rounded limbs are like jeweled chains, the work of a master hand. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Your body is like a round goblet in which no mixed wine is wanting. Your abdomen is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Your two breasts are like two fawns, the twins of a gazelle. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your neck is like a tower of ivory, your eyes like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple. [Then seeing the king watching the girl in absorbed admiration, the speaker added] The king is held captive by its tresses. 

<sup>6</sup> 

[The king came forward, saying] How fair and how pleasant you are, O love, with your delights! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Your stature is like that of a palm tree, and your bosom like its clusters [of dates, declared the king]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I resolve that I will climb the palm tree; I will grasp its branches. Let your breasts be like clusters of the grapevine, and the scent of your breath like apples, 

<sup>9</sup> 

And your kisses like the best wine--[then the Shulammite interrupted] that goes down smoothly and sweetly for my beloved [shepherd, kisses] gliding over his lips while he sleeps! 

<sup>10</sup> 

[She proudly said] I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me! 

<sup>11</sup> 

[She said] Come, my beloved! Let us go forth into the field, let us lodge in the villages. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened, and whether the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved!
