Thus the Lord God showed me [Amos], and behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the second crop, and behold, it was the second crop after the king's mowings. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And when [the locusts] had finished eating the plants of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I pray You. How can Jacob stand? For he is so small! 

<sup>3</sup> 

The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: It shall not take place, said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Thus the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God called for punishment with fire, and it devoured the great deep and would have eaten up the land. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I pray You! How can Jacob stand? He is so little! 

<sup>6</sup> 

The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: This also shall not be, said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall with a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the Lord said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I am setting a plumb line as a standard in the midst of My people Israel. I will not pass by and spare them any more [the door of mercy is shut]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the [idolatrous] high places of Isaac (Israel) shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise with the sword against the house of King Jeroboam [who set up the golden calf shrines]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then Amaziah the priest of [the golden calf shrine at] Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For thus Amos has said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Also Amaziah said to Amos, O you seer, go! Flee back to the land of Judah [your own country], and eat your bread and live out your profession as a prophet there [as I perform my duties here]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But do not prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary and a seat of his kingdom. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then Amos said to Amaziah, I was no prophet [by profession]! Neither was I a prophet's son; [but I had my occupation] I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees and a gatherer of sycamore figs. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Now therefore listen to the word of the Lord: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel and drop no statements not complimentary to the house of Isaac. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided up by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean and defiled land, and Israel shall surely go forth out of his land into exile.
