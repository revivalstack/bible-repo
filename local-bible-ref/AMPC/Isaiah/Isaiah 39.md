At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent [messengers with] letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Hezekiah was glad and welcomed them and showed them the house of his spices and precious things--the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious ointment, all the house of his armor and his jewels, and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.

Then came Isaiah the prophet to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? From where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They came to me from a far country, even from Babylon. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then Isaiah said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah answered, They have seen all that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 

<sup>6</sup> 

Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your predecessors have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And some of your own sons who are born to you shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good. And he added, For there will be peace and faithfulness [to His promises to us] in my days.
