Oh, that You would rend the heavens and that You would come down, that the mountains might quake and flow down at Your presence-- 

<sup>2</sup> 

As when fire kindles the brushwood and the fire causes the waters to boil--to make Your name known to Your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at Your presence! 

<sup>3</sup> 

When You did terrible things which we did not expect, You came down; the mountains quaked at Your presence. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For from of old no one has heard nor perceived by the ear, nor has the eye seen a God besides You, Who works and shows Himself active on behalf of him who [earnestly] waits for Him. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You meet and spare him who joyfully works righteousness (uprightness and justice), [earnestly] remembering You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, for we sinned; we have long continued in our sins [prolonging Your anger]. And shall we be saved? 

<sup>6</sup> 

For we have all become like one who is unclean [ceremonially, like a leper], and all our righteousness (our best deeds of rightness and justice) is like filthy rags or a polluted garment; we all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away [far from God's favor, hurrying us toward destruction]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And no one calls on Your name and awakens and bestirs himself to take and keep hold of You; for You have hidden Your face from us and have delivered us into the [consuming] power of our iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Yet, O Lord, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You our Potter, and we all are the work of Your hand. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Do not be exceedingly angry, O Lord, or [seriously] remember iniquity forever. Behold, consider, we beseech You, we are all Your people. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Our holy and our beautiful house, [the temple] where our fathers praised You, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant and desirable places are in ruins. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Considering these [calamities], will You restrain Yourself, O Lord [and not come to our aid]? Will You keep silent and not command our deliverance but humble and afflict us exceedingly?
