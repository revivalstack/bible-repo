The mournful, inspired prediction (a burden to be lifted up) concerning Babylon which Isaiah son of Amoz saw [with prophetic insight]: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Raise up a signal banner upon the high and bare mountain, summon them [the Medes and Persians] with loud voice and beckoning hand that they may enter the gates of the [Babylonian] nobles. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I Myself [says the Lord] have commanded My designated ones and have summoned My mighty men to execute My anger, even My proudly exulting ones [the Medes and Persians]--those who are made to triumph for My honor. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Hark, the uproar of a multitude in the mountains, like that of a great people! The noise of the tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathering together! The Lord of hosts is mustering the host for the battle. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They come from a distant country, from the uttermost part of the heavens [the far east]--even the Lord and the weapons of His indignation--to seize and destroy the whole land. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Wail, for the day of the Lord is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty and Sufficient One [Shaddai] will it come! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Therefore will all hands be feeble, and every man's heart will melt. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And they [of Babylon] shall be dismayed and terrified, pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in childbirth. They will gaze stupefied and aghast at one another, their faces will be aflame [from the effects of the unprecedented warfare]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Behold, the day of the Lord is coming!--fierce, with wrath and raging anger--to make the land and the [whole] earth a desolation and to destroy out of it its sinners. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be darkened at its rising and the moon will not shed its light. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And I, the Lord, will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their guilt and iniquity; I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible and the boasting of the violent and ruthless. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I will make a man more rare than fine gold, and mankind scarcer than the pure gold of Ophir. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth shall be shaken out of its place at the wrath of the Lord of hosts in the day of His fierce anger. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And like the chased roe or gazelle, and like sheep that no man gathers, each [foreign resident] will turn to his own people, and each will flee to his own land. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Everyone who is found will be thrust through, and everyone who is connected with the slain and is caught will fall by the sword. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Their infants also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold [and thus cannot be bribed]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Their bows will cut down the young men [of Babylon]; and they will have no pity on the fruit of the womb, their eyes will not spare children. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans' pride, shall be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them. 

<sup>20</sup> 

[Babylon] shall never be inhabited or dwelt in from generation to generation; neither shall the Arab pitch his tent there, nor shall the shepherds make their sheepfolds there. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But wild beasts of the desert will lie down there, and the people's houses will be full of dolefully howling creatures; and ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats [like demons] will dance there. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And wolves and howling creatures will cry and answer in the deserted castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces. And [Babylon's] time has nearly come, and her days will not be prolonged.
