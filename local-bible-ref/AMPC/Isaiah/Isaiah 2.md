The word which Isaiah son of Amoz saw [revealed] concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> 

It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be [firmly] established as the highest of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow to it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And many people shall come and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us His ways and that we may walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law and instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And He shall judge between the nations and shall decide [disputes] for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. 

<sup>5</sup> 

O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Surely [Lord] You have rejected and forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the east and with soothsayers [who foretell] like the Philistines; also they strike hands and make pledges and agreements with the children of aliens. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Their land also is full of silver and gold; neither is there any end to their treasures. Their land is also full of horses; neither is there any end to their chariots. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, what their own fingers have made. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the common man is bowed down [before idols], also the great man is brought low and humbles himself--therefore forgive them not [O Lord]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Enter into the rock and hide yourself in the dust from before the terror of the Lord and from the glory of His majesty. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The proud looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For there shall be a day of the Lord of hosts against all who are proud and haughty and against all who are lifted up--and they shall be brought low-- 

<sup>13</sup> 

[The wrath of God will begin by coming down] against all the cedars of Lebanon [west of the Jordan] that are high and lifted up, and against all the oaks of Bashan [east of the Jordan], 

<sup>14</sup> 

And [after that] against all the high mountains and all the hills that are lifted up, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And against every high tower and every fenced wall, 

<sup>16</sup> 

And against all the ships of Tarshish and all the picturesque and desirable imagery [designed for mere ornament and luxury]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And the idols shall utterly pass away (be abolished). 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then shall [the stricken, deprived of all in which they had trusted] go into the caves of the rocks and into the holes of the earth from before the terror and dread of the Lord and from before the glory of His majesty, when He arises to shake mightily and terribly the earth. 

<sup>20</sup> 

In that day men shall cast away to the moles and to the bats their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, 

<sup>21</sup> 

To go into the caverns of the rocks and into the clefts of the ragged rocks from before the terror and dread of the Lord and from before the glory of His majesty, when He rises to shake mightily and terribly the earth. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Cease to trust in [weak, frail, and dying] man, whose breath is in his nostrils [for so short a time]; in what sense can he be counted as having intrinsic worth?
