<sup>1</sup> 

Come near, you nations, to hear; and hearken, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it; the world, and all things that come forth from it. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For the Lord is indignant against all nations, and His wrath is against all their host. He has utterly doomed them, He has given them over to slaughter. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall rise, and the mountains shall flow with their blood. 

<sup>4</sup> 

All the host of the heavens shall be dissolved and crumble away, and the skies shall be rolled together like a scroll; and all their host [the stars and the planets] shall drop like a faded leaf from the vine, and like a withered fig from the fig tree. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Because My sword has been bathed and equipped in heaven, behold, it shall come down upon Edom [the descendants of Esau], upon the people whom I have doomed for judgment. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The sword of the Lord is filled with blood [of sacrifices], it is gorged and greased with fatness--with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah [capital of Edom] and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And the wild oxen shall fall with them, and the [young] bullocks with the [old and mighty] bulls; and their land shall be drunk and soaked with blood, and their dust made rich with fatness. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For the Lord has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense, for the cause of Zion. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the streams [of Edom] will be turned into pitch and its dust into brimstone, and its land will become burning pitch. 

<sup>10</sup> 

[The burning of Edom] shall not be quenched night or day; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it; the owl and the bittern and the raven will dwell in it. And He will stretch over it [Edom] the measuring line of confusion and the plummet stones of chaos [over its nobles]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They shall call its nobles to proclaim the kingdom, but nothing shall be there, and all its princes shall be no more. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And thorns shall come up in its palaces and strongholds, nettles and brambles in its fortresses; and it shall be a habitation for jackals, an abode for ostriches. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the wild beasts of the desert will meet here with howling creatures [wolves and hyenas] and the [shaggy] wild goat will call to his fellow; the night monster will settle there and find a place of rest. 

<sup>15</sup> 

There shall the arrow snake make her nest and lay her eggs and hatch them and gather her young under her shade; there shall the kites be gathered [also to breed] every one with its mate. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Seek out of the book of the Lord and read: not one of these [details of prophecy] shall fail, none shall want and lack her mate [in fulfillment]. For the mouth [of the Lord] has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has portioned [Edom] to [the wild beasts] by measuring line. They shall possess it forever; from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
