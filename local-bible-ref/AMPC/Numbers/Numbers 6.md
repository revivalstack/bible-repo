And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, When either a man or a woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, that is, one separated and consecrated to the Lord, 

<sup>3</sup> 

He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or of strong drink, and shall drink no grape juice, or eat grapes, fresh or dried. 

<sup>4</sup> 

All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing produced from the grapevine, not even the seeds or the skins. 

<sup>5</sup> 

All the days of the vow of his separation and abstinence there shall no razor come upon his head. Until the time is completed for which he separates himself to the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. 

<sup>6</sup> 

All the days that he separates himself to the Lord he shall not go near a dead body. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He shall not make himself unclean for his father, mother, brother, or sister, when they die, because his separation and abstinence to his God is upon his head. 

<sup>8</sup> 

All the days of his separation and abstinence he is holy to the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he has defiled his consecrated head, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day shall he shave it. 

<sup>10</sup> 

On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the Tent of Meeting, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make atonement for him because he sinned by reason of the dead body. He shall consecrate his head the same day, 

<sup>12</sup> 

And he shall consecrate and separate himself to the Lord for the days of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass or guilt offering; but the previous days shall be void and lost, because his separation was defiled. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation and abstinence are fulfilled. He shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting, 

<sup>14</sup> 

And he shall offer his gift to the Lord, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace offering, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread spread with oil, and their cereal offering, and their drink offering. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the priest shall present them before the Lord and shall offer the person's sin offering and his burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also its cereal offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaven the hair of his separation and abstinence. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord; they are a holy portion for the priest, with the breast that is waved and the thigh or shoulder that is offered; and after that the Nazirite may drink wine. 

<sup>21</sup> 

This is the law for the Nazirite who has made a vow. His offering to the Lord, besides what else he is able to afford, shall be according to the vow which he has vowed; so shall he do according to the law for his separation and abstinence [as a Nazirite]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>23</sup> 

Say to Aaron and his sons, This is the way you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them, 

<sup>24</sup> 

The Lord bless you and watch, guard, and keep you; 

<sup>25</sup> 

The Lord make His face to shine upon and enlighten you and be gracious (kind, merciful, and giving favor) to you; 

<sup>26</sup> 

The Lord lift up His [approving] countenance upon you and give you peace (tranquility of heart and life continually). 

<sup>27</sup> 

And they shall put My name upon the Israelites, and I will bless them.
