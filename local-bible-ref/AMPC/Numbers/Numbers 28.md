And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Command the Israelites, saying, My offering, My food for My offerings made by fire, My sweet and soothing odor you shall be careful to offer to Me at its proper time. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And you shall say to the people, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the Lord: two male lambs a year old without spot or blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. 

<sup>4</sup> 

One lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other in the evening, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Also a tenth of an ephah of flour for a cereal offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil. 

<sup>6</sup> 

It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a sweet and soothing odor, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Its drink offering shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb; in the Holy Place you shall pour out a fermented drink offering to the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the other lamb you shall offer in the evening; like the cereal offering of the morning and like its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering made by fire, a sweet and soothing odor to the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without spot or blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of flour for a cereal offering, mixed with oil, and its drink offering. 

<sup>10</sup> 

This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And at the beginning of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without spot or blemish; 

<sup>12</sup> 

And three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a cereal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a cereal offering, mixed with oil, for the one ram. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil as a cereal offering, for each lamb, for a burnt offering of a sweet and pleasant fragrance, an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and a third of a hin for a ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And one male goat for a sin offering to the Lord--it shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>16</sup> 

On the fourteenth day of the first month is the Lord's Passover. 

<sup>17</sup> 

On the fifteenth day of this month is a feast; for seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. 

<sup>18</sup> 

On the first day there shall be a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no servile work that day. 

<sup>19</sup> 

But you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish to the best of your knowledge. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And their cereal offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil; three-tenths of an ephah shall you offer for a bull, and two-tenths for a ram; 

<sup>21</sup> 

A tenth shall you offer for each of the seven male lambs, 

<sup>22</sup> 

Also one male goat for a sin offering to make atonement for you. 

<sup>23</sup> 

You shall offer these in addition to the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 

<sup>24</sup> 

In this way you shall offer daily for seven days the food of an offering made by fire, a sweet and soothing odor to the Lord; it shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And on the seventh day you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no work befitting a slave or a servant. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Also in the day of the firstfruits, when you offer a cereal offering of new grain to the Lord at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no servile work. 

<sup>27</sup> 

But you shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet, pleasing, and soothing fragrance to the Lord: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old, 

<sup>28</sup> 

And their cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil, three-tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths for one ram, 

<sup>29</sup> 

A tenth for each of the seven male lambs, 

<sup>30</sup> 

And one male goat to make atonement for you. 

<sup>31</sup> 

You shall offer them in addition to the continual burnt offering and its cereal offering and their drink offerings. See that they are without blemish.
