The Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they came out of the land of Egypt, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Take a census of all the males of the congregation of the Israelites by families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, head by head. 

<sup>3</sup> 

From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go forth to war you and Aaron shall number, company by company. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And with you there shall be a man [to assist you] from each tribe, each being the head of his father's house. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And these are the names of the men who shall attend you: Of Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Of Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Of Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Of Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Of Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon; 

<sup>10</sup> 

Of the sons of Joseph: of Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; of Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; 

<sup>11</sup> 

Of Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Of Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; 

<sup>13</sup> 

Of Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran; 

<sup>14</sup> 

Of Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; 

<sup>15</sup> 

Of Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan. 

<sup>16</sup> 

These were those chosen from the congregation, the leaders of their ancestral tribes, heads of thousands [the highest class of officers] in Israel. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And Moses and Aaron took these men who have been named, 

<sup>18</sup> 

And assembled all the congregation on the first day of the second month, and they declared their ancestry after their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, head by head, 

<sup>19</sup> 

As the Lord commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The sons of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 

<sup>21</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Of the sons of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, those numbered of them according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 

<sup>23</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Of the sons of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 

<sup>25</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Of the sons of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>27</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Of the sons of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>29</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Of the sons of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>31</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Of the sons of Joseph: the sons of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>33</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Of the sons of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>35</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200. 

<sup>36</sup> 

Of the sons of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>37</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Of the sons of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>39</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700. 

<sup>40</sup> 

Of the sons of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>41</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500. 

<sup>42</sup> 

Of the sons of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all able to go to war: 

<sup>43</sup> 

Those of the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400. 

<sup>44</sup> 

These were numbered by Moses and Aaron, and the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each representing his father's house. 

<sup>45</sup> 

So all those numbered of the Israelites, by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, able to go to war in Israel, 

<sup>46</sup> 

All who were numbered were 603,550. 

<sup>47</sup> 

But the Levites by their fathers' tribe were not numbered with them. 

<sup>48</sup> 

For the Lord had said to Moses, 

<sup>49</sup> 

Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number in the census of the Israelites. 

<sup>50</sup> 

But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its vessels and furnishings and all things that belong to it. They shall carry the tabernacle [when journeying] and all its furnishings, and they shall minister to it and encamp around it. 

<sup>51</sup> 

When the tabernacle is to go forward, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And the excluded [any not of the tribe of Levi] who approach the tabernacle shall be put to death. 

<sup>52</sup> 

The Israelites shall pitch their tents by their companies, every man by his own camp and every man by his own [tribal] standard. 

<sup>53</sup> 

But the Levites shall encamp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath upon the congregation of the Israelites; and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony. 

<sup>54</sup> 

Thus did the Israelites; according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so they did.
