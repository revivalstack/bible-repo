And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Make two trumpets of silver; of hammered or turned work you shall make them, that you may use them to call the congregation and for breaking camp. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When they both are blown, all the congregation shall assemble before you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And if one blast on a single trumpet is blown, then the princes or leaders, heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 

<sup>5</sup> 

When you blow an alarm, the camps on the east side [of the tabernacle] shall set out. 

<sup>6</sup> 

When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps on the south side shall set out. An alarm shall be blown whenever they are to set out on their journeys. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When the congregation is to be assembled, you shall blow [the trumpets in short, sharp tones], but not the blast of an alarm. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets, and the trumpets shall be to you for a perpetual statute throughout your generations. 

<sup>9</sup> 

When you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then blow an alarm with the trumpets, that you may be remembered before the Lord your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Also in the day of rejoicing, and in your set feasts, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; thus they may be a remembrance before your God. I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>11</sup> 

On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year [since leaving Egypt], the cloud [of the Lord's presence] was taken up from over the tabernacle of the Testimony, 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the Israelites took their journey by stages out of the Wilderness of Sinai, and the [guiding] cloud rested in the Wilderness of Paran. 

<sup>13</sup> 

When the journey was to begin, at the command of the Lord through Moses, 

<sup>14</sup> 

In the first place went the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah by their companies; and over their host was Nahshon son of Amminadab. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel son of Zuar. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab son of Helon. 

<sup>17</sup> 

When the tabernacle was taken down, the sons of Gershon and Merari, bearing [it] on their shoulders, set out. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The standard of the camp of Reuben set forward by their companies; and over Reuben's host was Elizur son of Shedeur. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph son of Deuel. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then the Kohathites set forward, bearing the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before they arrived. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their companies; and over Ephraim's host was Elishama son of Ammihud. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan son of Gideoni. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their companies; and over Dan's host was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel son of Ochran. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira son of Enan. 

<sup>28</sup> 

This was the Israelites' order of march by their hosts when they set out. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which the Lord said, I will give it to you. Come with us, and we will do you good, for the Lord has promised good concerning Israel. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And Hobab said to him, I will not go; I will depart to my own land and to my family. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And Moses said, Do not leave us, I pray you; for you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us. 

<sup>32</sup> 

And if you will go with us, it shall be that whatever good the Lord does to us, the same we will do to you. 

<sup>33</sup> 

They departed from the mountain of the Lord [Mount Sinai] three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them during the three days' journey to seek out a resting-place for them. 

<sup>34</sup> 

The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they went forward from the camp. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, Rise up, Lord; let Your enemies be scattered; and let those who hate You flee before You. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, to the ten thousand thousands in Israel.
