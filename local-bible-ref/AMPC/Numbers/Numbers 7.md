On the day that Moses had fully completed setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture, and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed and set them apart for holy use, 

<sup>2</sup> 

The princes or leaders of Israel, heads of their fathers' houses, made offerings. These were the leaders of the tribes and were over those who were numbered. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for each two of the princes or leaders and an ox for each one; and they brought them before the tabernacle. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Accept the things from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So Moses took the wagons and the oxen and gave them to the Levites.

Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service; 

<sup>8</sup> 

And four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the supervision of Ithamar son of Aaron, the [high] priest. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because they were assigned the care of the sanctuary and the holy things which had to be carried on their shoulders. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the princes or leaders offered sacrifices for the dedication of the altar [of burnt offering] on the day that it was anointed; and they offered their sacrifice before the altar.
