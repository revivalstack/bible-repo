<sup>1</sup> 

And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height. 

<sup>4</sup> 

God met Balaam, who said to Him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the Lord put a speech in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak and thus shall you speak. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Balaam returned to Balak, who was standing by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the princes of Moab. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Balaam took up his [figurative] speech and said: Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me; and come, violently denounce Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> 

How can I curse those God has not cursed? Or how can I [violently] denounce those the Lord has not denounced? 

<sup>9</sup> 

For from the top of the rocks I see Israel, and from the hills I behold him. Behold, the people [of Israel] shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned and esteemed among the nations. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who can count the dust (the descendants) of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God], and let my last end be like theirs! 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, and here you have [thoroughly] blessed them instead! 

<sup>12</sup> 

And Balaam answered, Must I not be obedient and speak what the Lord has put in my mouth? 

<sup>13</sup> 

Balak said to him, Come with me, I implore you, to another place from which you can see them, though you will see only the nearest and not all of them; and curse them for me from there. 

<sup>14</sup> 

So he took Balaam into the field of Zophim to the top of [Mount] Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Balaam said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering while I go to meet the Lord yonder. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the Lord met Balaam and put a speech in his mouth, and said, Go again to Balak and speak thus. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And when he returned to Balak, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has the Lord said? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Balaam took up his [figurative] discourse and said: Rise up, Balak, and hear; listen [closely] to me, son of Zippor. 

<sup>19</sup> 

God is not a man, that He should tell or act a lie, neither the son of man, that He should feel repentance or compunction [for what He has promised]. Has He said and shall He not do it? Or has He spoken and shall He not make it good? 

<sup>20</sup> 

You see, I have received His command to bless Israel. He has blessed, and I cannot reverse or qualify it. 

<sup>21</sup> 

[God] has not beheld iniquity in Jacob [for he is forgiven], neither has He seen mischief or perverseness in Israel [for the same reason]. The Lord their God is with Israel, and the shout of praise to their King is among the people. 

<sup>22</sup> 

God brought them forth out of Egypt; they have as it were the strength of a wild ox. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Surely there is no enchantment with or against Jacob, neither is there any divination with or against Israel. [In due season and even] now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought! 

<sup>24</sup> 

Behold, a people! They rise up as a lioness and lift themselves up as a lion; he shall not lie down until he devours the prey and drinks the blood of the slain. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But Balaam answered Balak, Did I not say to you, All the Lord speaks, that I must do? 

<sup>27</sup> 

And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I implore you; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there. 

<sup>28</sup> 

So Balak brought Balaam to the top of [Mount] Peor, that overlooks [the wilderness or desert] Jeshimon. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
