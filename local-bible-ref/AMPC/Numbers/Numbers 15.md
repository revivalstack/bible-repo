And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, When you come into the land where you are to live, which I am giving you, 

<sup>3</sup> 

And will make an offering by fire to the Lord from the herd or from the flock, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then shall he who brings his offering to the Lord bring a cereal offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And a fourth of a hin of wine for the drink offering you shall prepare with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Or for a ram you shall prepare for a cereal offering two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, for a sweet and pleasing odor to the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, in fulfilling a special vow or peace offering to the Lord, 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then shall one offer with the bull a cereal offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And you shall bring for the drink offering half a hin of wine for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Thus shall it be done for each bull or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs or of the kids. 

<sup>12</sup> 

According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you do to everyone according to their number. 

<sup>13</sup> 

All who are native-born shall do these things in this way in bringing an offering made by fire of a sweet and pleasant odor to the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And if a stranger sojourns with you or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasing and soothing fragrance to the Lord, as you do, so shall he do. 

<sup>15</sup> 

There shall be one [and the same] statute [both] for you [of the congregation] and for the stranger who is a temporary resident with you, a statute forever throughout your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. 

<sup>16</sup> 

One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>18</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, When you come into the land to which I am bringing you, 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then, when you eat of the food of the land, you shall set apart a portion for a gift to the Lord [called a heave or taken-out offering]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You shall set apart a cake made of the first of your coarse meal as a gift [to the Lord]; as an offering set apart from the threshing floor, so shall you lift it out or heave it. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Of the first of your coarse meal you shall give to the Lord a portion for a gift throughout your generations [your heave or lifted-out offering]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

When you have erred and have not observed all these commandments which the Lord has spoken to Moses, 

<sup>23</sup> 

Even all that the Lord has commanded you through Moses, from the day that the Lord gave commandment and onward throughout your generations, 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly or in error without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant and soothing fragrance to the Lord, with its cereal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the Israelites, and they shall be forgiven, for it was an error and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord for their error. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And all the congregation of the Israelites shall be forgiven and the stranger who lives temporarily among them, because all the people were involved in the error. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And if any person sins unknowingly or unintentionally, he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And the priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the person who commits an error when he sins unknowingly or unintentionally, to make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. 

<sup>29</sup> 

You shall have one law for him who sins unknowingly or unintentionally, whether he is native born among the Israelites or a stranger who is sojourning among them. 

<sup>30</sup> 

But the person who does anything [wrong] willfully and openly, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one reproaches, reviles, and blasphemes the Lord, and that person shall be cut off from among his people [that the atonement made for them may not include him]. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Because he has despised and rejected the word of the Lord, and has broken His commandment, that person shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. 

<sup>32</sup> 

While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man who was gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation. 

<sup>34</sup> 

They put him in custody, because it was not certain or clear what should be done to him. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him to death with stones, as the Lord commanded Moses. 

<sup>37</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>38</sup> 

Speak to the Israelites and bid them make fringes or tassels on the corners in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and put upon the fringe of the borders or upon the tassel of each corner a cord of blue. 

<sup>39</sup> 

And it shall be to you a fringe or tassel that you may look upon and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them, that you may not spy out and follow after [the desires of] your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to follow and play the harlot [spiritually, if not physically], 

<sup>40</sup> 

That you may remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God. 

<sup>41</sup> 

I am the Lord your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.
