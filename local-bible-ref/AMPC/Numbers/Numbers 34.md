And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Command the Israelites, When you come into the land of Canaan (which is the land that shall be yours for an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries), 

<sup>3</sup> 

Your south side shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern boundary from the end of the Salt [Dead] Sea eastward. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your boundary shall turn south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin, and its end shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall go on to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then the boundary shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt, and it shall terminate at the [Mediterranean] Sea. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For the western boundary you shall have the Great Sea and its coast. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea mark out your boundary line to Mount Hor; 

<sup>8</sup> 

From Mount Hor you shall mark out your boundary to the entrance of Hamath, and its end shall be at Zedad; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then the northern boundary shall go on to Ziphron, and the end of it shall be at Hazar-enan. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You shall mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham; 

<sup>11</sup> 

The boundary shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and shall descend and reach to the shoulder of the Sea of Chinnereth [the Sea of Galilee] on the east; 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the boundary shall go down to the Jordan, and the end shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land with its boundaries all around. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Moses commanded the Israelites, This is the land you shall inherit by lot, which the Lord has commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half-tribe [of Manasseh], 

<sup>14</sup> 

For the tribes of the sons of Reuben and of Gad by their fathers' houses have received their inheritance, and also the half-tribe of Manasseh. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance east of the Jordan at Jericho, toward the sunrise. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>17</sup> 

These are the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And [with them] you shall take one head or prince of each tribe to divide the land for inheritance. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The names of the men are: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 

<sup>20</sup> 

Of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Ammihud; 

<sup>21</sup> 

Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon; 

<sup>22</sup> 

Of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki son of Jogli; 

<sup>23</sup> 

Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel son of Ephod; 

<sup>24</sup> 

And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel son of Shiphtan; 

<sup>25</sup> 

And of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan son of Parnach; 

<sup>26</sup> 

And of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel son of Azzan; 

<sup>27</sup> 

And of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud son of Shelomi; 

<sup>28</sup> 

And of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel son of Ammihud. 

<sup>29</sup> 

These are the men whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
