<sup>1</sup> 

Do not let your hearts be troubled (distressed, agitated). You believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely on God; believe in and adhere to and trust in and rely also on Me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

In My Father's house there are many dwelling places (homes). If it were not so, I would have told you; for I am going away to prepare a place for you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And when (if) I go and make ready a place for you, I will come back again and will take you to Myself, that where I am you may be also. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And [to the place] where I am going, you know the way. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Thomas said to Him, Lord, we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Jesus said to him, I am the Way and the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except by (through) Me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

If you had known Me [had learned to recognize Me], you would also have known My Father. From now on, you know Him and have seen Him. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father [cause us to see the Father--that is all we ask]; then we shall be satisfied. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Jesus replied, Have I been with all of you for so long a time, and do you not recognize and know Me yet, Philip? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say then, Show us the Father? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in Me? What I am telling you I do not say on My own authority and of My own accord; but the Father Who lives continually in Me does the (His) works (His own miracles, deeds of power). 

<sup>11</sup> 

Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me; or else believe Me for the sake of the [very] works themselves. [If you cannot trust Me, at least let these works that I do in My Father's name convince you.] 

<sup>12</sup> 

I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, if anyone steadfastly believes in Me, he will himself be able to do the things that I do; and he will do even greater things than these, because I go to the Father. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And I will do [I Myself will grant] whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I Am], so that the Father may be glorified and extolled in (through) the Son. 

<sup>14</sup> 

[Yes] I will grant [I Myself will do for you] whatever you shall ask in My Name [as presenting all that I Am]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

If you [really] love Me, you will keep (obey) My commands. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby), that He may remain with you forever-- 

<sup>17</sup> 

The Spirit of Truth, Whom the world cannot receive (welcome, take to its heart), because it does not see Him or know and recognize Him. But you know and recognize Him, for He lives with you [constantly] and will be in you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

I will not leave you as orphans [comfortless, desolate, bereaved, forlorn, helpless]; I will come [back] to you. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Just a little while now, and the world will not see Me any more, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. 

<sup>20</sup> 

At that time [when that day comes] you will know [for yourselves] that I am in My Father, and you [are] in Me, and I [am] in you. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The person who has My commands and keeps them is the one who [really] loves Me; and whoever [really] loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I [too] will love him and will show (reveal, manifest) Myself to him. [I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him.] 

<sup>22</sup> 

Judas, not Iscariot, asked Him, Lord, how is it that You will reveal Yourself [make Yourself real] to us and not to the world? 

<sup>23</sup> 

Jesus answered, If a person [really] loves Me, he will keep My word [obey My teaching]; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home (abode, special dwelling place) with him. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Anyone who does not [really] love Me does not observe and obey My teaching. And the teaching which you hear and heed is not Mine, but [comes] from the Father Who sent Me. 

<sup>25</sup> 

I have told you these things while I am still with you. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, Standby), the Holy Spirit, Whom the Father will send in My name [in My place, to represent Me and act on My behalf], He will teach you all things. And He will cause you to recall (will remind you of, bring to your remembrance) everything I have told you. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Peace I leave with you; My [own] peace I now give and bequeath to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid. [Stop allowing yourselves to be agitated and disturbed; and do not permit yourselves to be fearful and intimidated and cowardly and unsettled.] 

<sup>28</sup> 

You heard Me tell you, I am going away and I am coming [back] to you. If you [really] loved Me, you would have been glad, because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater and mightier than I am. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And now I have told you [this] before it occurs, so that when it does take place you may believe and have faith in and rely on Me. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I will not talk with you much more, for the prince (evil genius, ruler) of the world is coming. And he has no claim on Me. [He has nothing in common with Me; there is nothing in Me that belongs to him, and he has no power over Me.] 

<sup>31</sup> 

But [Satan is coming and] I do as the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know (be convinced) that I love the Father and that I do only what the Father has instructed Me to do. [I act in full agreement with His orders.] Rise, let us go away from here.
