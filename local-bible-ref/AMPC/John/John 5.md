Later on there was a Jewish festival (feast) for which Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Now there is in Jerusalem a pool near the Sheep Gate. This pool in the Hebrew is called Bethesda, having five porches (alcoves, colonnades, doorways). 

<sup>3</sup> 

In these lay a great number of sick folk--some blind, some crippled, and some paralyzed (shriveled up)--waiting for the bubbling up of the water. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For an angel of the Lord went down at appointed seasons into the pool and moved and stirred up the water; whoever then first, after the stirring up of the water, stepped in was cured of whatever disease with which he was afflicted. 

<sup>5</sup> 

There was a certain man there who had suffered with a deep-seated and lingering disorder for thirty-eight years. 

<sup>6</sup> 

When Jesus noticed him lying there [helpless], knowing that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to become well? [Are you really in earnest about getting well?] 

<sup>7</sup> 

The invalid answered, Sir, I have nobody when the water is moving to put me into the pool; but while I am trying to come [into it] myself, somebody else steps down ahead of me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Jesus said to him, Get up! Pick up your bed (sleeping pad) and walk! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Instantly the man became well and recovered his strength and picked up his bed and walked. But that happened on the Sabbath. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So the Jews kept saying to the man who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and you have no right to pick up your bed [it is not lawful]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He answered them, The Man Who healed me and gave me back my strength, He Himself said to me, Pick up your bed and walk! 

<sup>12</sup> 

They asked him, Who is the Man Who told you, Pick up your bed and walk? 

<sup>13</sup> 

Now the invalid who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had quietly gone away [had passed on unnoticed], since there was a crowd in the place. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Afterward, when Jesus found him in the temple, He said to him, See, you are well! Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus Who had made him well. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For this reason the Jews began to persecute (annoy, torment) Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But Jesus answered them, My Father has worked [even] until now, [He has never ceased working; He is still working] and I, too, must be at [divine] work. 

<sup>18</sup> 

This made the Jews more determined than ever to kill Him [to do away with Him]; because He not only was breaking (weakening, violating) the Sabbath, but He actually was speaking of God as being [in a special sense] His own Father, making Himself equal [putting Himself on a level] with God. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So Jesus answered them by saying, I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the Son is able to do nothing of Himself (of His own accord); but He is able to do only what He sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father does is what the Son does in the same way [in His turn]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The Father dearly loves the Son and discloses to (shows) Him everything that He Himself does. And He will disclose to Him (let Him see) greater things yet than these, so that you may marvel and be full of wonder and astonishment. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Just as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life [makes them live on], even so the Son also gives life to whomever He wills and is pleased to give it. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Even the Father judges no one, for He has given all judgment (the last judgment and the whole business of judging) entirely into the hands of the Son, 

<sup>23</sup> 

So that all men may give honor (reverence, homage) to the Son just as they give honor to the Father. [In fact] whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, Who has sent Him. 

<sup>24</sup> 

I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the person whose ears are open to My words [who listens to My message] and believes and trusts in and clings to and relies on Him Who sent Me has (possesses now) eternal life. And he does not come into judgment [does not incur sentence of judgment, will not come under condemnation], but he has already passed over out of death into life. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Believe Me when I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, the time is coming and is here now when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear it shall live. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For even as the Father has life in Himself and is self-existent, so He has given to the Son to have life in Himself and be self-existent. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And He has given Him authority and granted Him power to execute (exercise, practice) judgment because He is a Son of man [very man]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Do not be surprised and wonder at this, for the time is coming when all those who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, 

<sup>29</sup> 

And they shall come out--those who have practiced doing good [will come out] to the resurrection of [new] life, and those who have done evil will be raised for judgment [raised to meet their sentence]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I am able to do nothing from Myself [independently, of My own accord--but only as I am taught by God and as I get His orders]. Even as I hear, I judge [I decide as I am bidden to decide. As the voice comes to Me, so I give a decision], and My judgment is right (just, righteous), because I do not seek or consult My own will [I have no desire to do what is pleasing to Myself, My own aim, My own purpose] but only the will and pleasure of the Father Who sent Me. 

<sup>31</sup> 

If I alone testify in My behalf, My testimony is not valid and cannot be worth anything. 

<sup>32</sup> 

There is Another Who testifies concerning Me, and I know and am certain that His evidence on My behalf is true and valid. 

<sup>33</sup> 

You yourselves have sent [an inquiry] to John and he has been a witness to the truth. 

<sup>34</sup> 

But I do not receive [a mere] human witness [the evidence which I accept on My behalf is not from man]; but I simply mention all these things in order that you may be saved (made and kept safe and sound). 

<sup>35</sup> 

John was the lamp that kept on burning and shining [to show you the way], and you were willing for a while to delight (sun) yourselves in his light. 

<sup>36</sup> 

But I have as My witness something greater (weightier, higher, better) than that of John; for the works that the Father has appointed Me to accomplish and finish, the very same works that I am now doing, are a witness and proof that the Father has sent Me. 

<sup>37</sup> 

And the Father Who sent Me has Himself testified concerning Me. Not one of you has ever given ear to His voice or seen His form (His face--what He is like). [You have always been deaf to His voice and blind to the vision of Him.] 

<sup>38</sup> 

And you have not His word (His thought) living in your hearts, because you do not believe and adhere to and trust in and rely on Him Whom He has sent. [That is why you do not keep His message living in you, because you do not believe in the Messenger Whom He has sent.] 

<sup>39</sup> 

You search and investigate and pore over the Scriptures diligently, because you suppose and trust that you have eternal life through them. And these [very Scriptures] testify about Me! 

<sup>40</sup> 

And still you are not willing [but refuse] to come to Me, so that you might have life. 

<sup>41</sup> 

I receive not glory from men [I crave no human honor, I look for no mortal fame], 

<sup>42</sup> 

But I know you and recognize and understand that you have not the love of God in you. 

<sup>43</sup> 

I have come in My Father's name and with His power, and you do not receive Me [your hearts are not open to Me, you give Me no welcome]; but if another comes in his own name and his own power and with no other authority but himself, you will receive him and give him your approval. 

<sup>44</sup> 

How is it possible for you to believe [how can you learn to believe], you who [are content to seek and] receive praise and honor and glory from one another, and yet do not seek the praise and honor and glory which come from Him Who alone is God? 

<sup>45</sup> 

Put out of your minds the thought and do not suppose [as some of you are supposing] that I will accuse you before the Father. There is one who accuses you--it is Moses, the very one on whom you have built your hopes [in whom you trust]. 

<sup>46</sup> 

For if you believed and relied on Moses, you would believe and rely on Me, for he wrote about Me [personally]. 

<sup>47</sup> 

But if you do not believe and trust his writings, how then will you believe and trust My teachings? [How shall you cleave to and rely on My words?]
