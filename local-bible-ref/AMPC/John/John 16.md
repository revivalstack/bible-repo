<sup>1</sup> 

I have told you all these things, so that you should not be offended (taken unawares and falter, or be caused to stumble and fall away). [I told you to keep you from being scandalized and repelled.] 

<sup>2</sup> 

They will put you out of (expel you from) the synagogues; but an hour is coming when whoever kills you will think and claim that he has offered service to God. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And they will do this because they have not known the Father or Me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But I have told you these things now, so that when they occur you will remember that I told you of them. I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But now I am going to Him Who sent Me, yet none of you asks Me, Where are You going? 

<sup>6</sup> 

But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts [taken complete possession of them]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

However, I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable (good, expedient, advantageous) for you that I go away. Because if I do not go away, the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) will not come to you [into close fellowship with you]; but if I go away, I will send Him to you [to be in close fellowship with you]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And when He comes, He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God) and about judgment: 

<sup>9</sup> 

About sin, because they do not believe in Me [trust in, rely on, and adhere to Me]; 

<sup>10</sup> 

About righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God), because I go to My Father, and you will see Me no longer; 

<sup>11</sup> 

About judgment, because the ruler (evil genius, prince) of this world [Satan] is judged and condemned and sentence already is passed upon him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I have still many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them or to take them upon you or to grasp them now. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But when He, the Spirit of Truth (the Truth-giving Spirit) comes, He will guide you into all the Truth (the whole, full Truth). For He will not speak His own message [on His own authority]; but He will tell whatever He hears [from the Father; He will give the message that has been given to Him], and He will announce and declare to you the things that are to come [that will happen in the future]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He will honor and glorify Me, because He will take of (receive, draw upon) what is Mine and will reveal (declare, disclose, transmit) it to you. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Everything that the Father has is Mine. That is what I meant when I said that He [the Spirit] will take the things that are Mine and will reveal (declare, disclose, transmit) it to you. 

<sup>16</sup> 

In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So some of His disciples questioned among themselves, What does He mean when He tells us, In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me, and, Because I go to My Father? 

<sup>18</sup> 

What does He mean by a little while? We do not know or understand what He is talking about. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Jesus knew that they wanted to ask Him, so He said to them, Are you wondering and inquiring among yourselves what I meant when I said, In a little while you will no longer see Me, and again after a short while you will see Me? 

<sup>20</sup> 

I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that you shall weep and grieve, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. 

<sup>21</sup> 

A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief (anguish, agony) because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she no longer remembers her pain (trouble, anguish) because she is so glad that a man (a child, a human being) has been born into the world. 

<sup>22</sup> 

So for the present you are also in sorrow (in distress and depressed); but I will see you again and [then] your hearts will rejoice, and no one can take from you your joy (gladness, delight). 

<sup>23</sup> 

And when that time comes, you will ask nothing of Me [you will need to ask Me no questions]. I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I Am]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Up to this time you have not asked a [single] thing in My Name [as presenting all that I Am]; but now ask and keep on asking and you will receive, so that your joy (gladness, delight) may be full and complete. 

<sup>25</sup> 

I have told you these things in parables (veiled language, allegories, dark sayings); the hour is now coming when I shall no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I shall tell you about the Father in plain words and openly (without reserve). 

<sup>26</sup> 

At that time you will ask (pray) in My Name; and I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf [for it will be unnecessary]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For the Father Himself [tenderly] loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from the Father. 

<sup>28</sup> 

I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father. 

<sup>29</sup> 

His disciples said, Ah, now You are speaking plainly to us and not in parables (veiled language and figures of speech)! 

<sup>30</sup> 

Now we know that You are acquainted with everything and have no need to be asked questions. Because of this we believe that you [really] came from God. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Jesus answered them, Do you now believe? [Do you believe it at last?] 

<sup>32</sup> 

But take notice, the hour is coming, and it has arrived, when you will all be dispersed and scattered, every man to his own home, leaving Me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. 

<sup>33</sup> 

I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer [take courage; be confident, certain, undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. [I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you.]
