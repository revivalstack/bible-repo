<sup>1</sup> 

I am the True Vine, and My Father is the Vinedresser. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit. 

<sup>3</sup> 

You are cleansed and pruned already, because of the word which I have given you [the teachings I have discussed with you]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Dwell in Me, and I will dwell in you. [Live in Me, and I will live in you.] Just as no branch can bear fruit of itself without abiding in (being vitally united to) the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in Me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I am the Vine; you are the branches. Whoever lives in Me and I in him bears much (abundant) fruit. However, apart from Me [cut off from vital union with Me] you can do nothing. 

<sup>6</sup> 

If a person does not dwell in Me, he is thrown out like a [broken-off] branch, and withers; such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire, and they are burned. 

<sup>7</sup> 

If you live in Me [abide vitally united to Me] and My words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

When you bear (produce) much fruit, My Father is honored and glorified, and you show and prove yourselves to be true followers of Mine. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I have loved you, [just] as the Father has loved Me; abide in My love [continue in His love with Me]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

If you keep My commandments [if you continue to obey My instructions], you will abide in My love and live on in it, just as I have obeyed My Father's commandments and live on in His love. 

<sup>11</sup> 

I have told you these things, that My joy and delight may be in you, and that your joy and gladness may be of full measure and complete and overflowing. 

<sup>12</sup> 

This is My commandment: that you love one another [just] as I have loved you. 

<sup>13</sup> 

No one has greater love [no one has shown stronger affection] than to lay down (give up) his own life for his friends. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You are My friends if you keep on doing the things which I command you to do. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I do not call you servants (slaves) any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing (working out). But I have called you My friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from My Father. [I have revealed to you everything that I have learned from Him.] 

<sup>16</sup> 

You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed you [I have planted you], that you might go and bear fruit and keep on bearing, and that your fruit may be lasting [that it may remain, abide], so that whatever you ask the Father in My Name [as presenting all that I Am], He may give it to you. 

<sup>17</sup> 

This is what I command you: that you love one another. 

<sup>18</sup> 

If the world hates you, know that it hated Me before it hated you. 

<sup>19</sup> 

If you belonged to the world, the world would treat you with affection and would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world [no longer one with it], but I have chosen (selected) you out of the world, the world hates (detests) you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Remember that I told you, A servant is not greater than his master [is not superior to him]. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word and obeyed My teachings, they will also keep and obey yours. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But they will do all this to you [inflict all this suffering on you] because of [your bearing] My name and on My account, for they do not know or understand the One Who sent Me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin [would be blameless]; but now they have no excuse for their sin. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Whoever hates Me also hates My Father. 

<sup>24</sup> 

If I had not done (accomplished) among them the works which no one else ever did, they would not be guilty of sin. But [the fact is] now they have both seen [these works] and have hated both Me and My Father. 

<sup>25</sup> 

But [this is so] that the word written in their Law might be fulfilled, They hated Me without a cause. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But when the Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) comes, Whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth Who comes (proceeds) from the Father, He [Himself] will testify regarding Me. 

<sup>27</sup> 

But you also will testify and be My witnesses, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
