These are the heads of their fathers' houses and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylonia in the reign of King Artaxerxes: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of Ithamar, Daniel; of David, Hattush 

<sup>3</sup> 

Of the sons of Shecaniah; of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men by genealogy; 

<sup>4</sup> 

Of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, with 200 men; 

<sup>5</sup> 

Of the sons of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, with 300 men; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Of the sons of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, with 50 men; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, with 70 men; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, with 80 men; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Of the sons of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, with 218 men; 

<sup>10</sup> 

Of the sons of [Bani], Shelomith son of Josiphiah, with 160 men; 

<sup>11</sup> 

Of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, with 28 men; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Of the sons of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, with 110 men; 

<sup>13</sup> 

Of the sons of Adonikam, the last to come, their names are Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, with 60 men; 

<sup>14</sup> 

Of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud [Zaccur], with 70 men. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I [Ezra] gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava, and there we encamped three days. I reviewed the people and the priests, and found no Levites. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, Meshullam, who were chief men, and also for Joiarib and Elnathan,who were teachers. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And I sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, telling them to say to Iddo and his brethren the Nethinim [temple servants] at the place Casiphia, Bring to us servants for the house of our God. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, named Sherebiah, with his sons and his kinsmen, 18; 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his kinsmen and their sons, 20; 

<sup>20</sup> 

Also 220 of the Nethinim, whose forefathers David and the officials had set apart [with their descendants] to attend the Levites. They were all mentioned by name. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a straight and right way for us, our little ones, and all our possessions. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For I was ashamed to request of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy along the way, because we had told the king, The hand of our God is upon all them for good who seek Him, but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him. 

<sup>23</sup> 

So we fasted and besought our God for this, and He heard our entreaty. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then I set apart twelve leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their kinsmen, 

<sup>25</sup> 

And weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God which the king, his counselors, his lords, and all Israel there present had offered. 

<sup>26</sup> 

I weighed into their hands 650 talents of silver, and silver vessels valued at 100 talents, and 100 talents of gold; 

<sup>27</sup> 

Also 20 basins of gold worth 1,000 darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze, precious as gold. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And I said to them, You are holy to the Lord, the vessels are holy also, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your fathers. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Guard and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and Levites and heads of the fathers' houses of Israel in Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the Lord. 

<sup>30</sup> 

So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver, the gold, and the vessels to bring them to Jerusalem into the house of our God. 

<sup>31</sup> 

We left the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the enemy and those who lay in wait by the way. 

<sup>32</sup> 

And we came to Jerusalem, and [had been] there three days. 

<sup>33</sup> 

On the fourth day, the silver, the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hands of Meremoth the priest, son of Uriah, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them were Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui--the Levites. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Every piece was counted and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at once. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Also those returned exiles whose parents had been carried into captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve young bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he-goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And they delivered the king's commissions to the king's lieutenants and to the governors west of the River, and they aided the people and God's house.
