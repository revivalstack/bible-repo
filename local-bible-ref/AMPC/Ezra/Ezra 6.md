Then King Darius [I] decreed, and a search was made in Babylonia in the house where the treasured records were stored. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And at Ecbatana in the capital in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was recorded: 

<sup>3</sup> 

In the first year of King Cyrus, [he] made a decree: Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem, let the house, the place where they offer sacrifices, be built, and let its foundations be strongly laid, its height and its breadth each 60 cubits, 

<sup>4</sup> 

With three courses of great stones and one course of new timber. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem, each put in its place in the house of God. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province [west of] the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the Apharsachites who are [west of] the River, keep far away from there. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Leave the work on this house of God alone; let the governor and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Moreover, I make a decree as to what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men at once from the king's revenue, the tribute of the province [west of] the River, that they may not be hindered. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And all they need, including young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests at Jerusalem, let it be given them each day without fail, 

<sup>10</sup> 

That they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Also I make a decree that whoever shall change or infringe on this order, let a beam be pulled from his house and erected; then let him be fastened to it, and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 

<sup>12</sup> 

May the God Who has caused His Name to dwell there overthrow all kings and peoples who put forth their hands to alter this or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be executed speedily and exactly. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then Tattenai, governor of the province this side of the River, with Shethar-bozenai and their associates, diligently did what King Darius had decreed. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished their building as commanded by the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the Israelites--the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles--celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. 

<sup>17</sup> 

They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 young bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and, for a sin offering for all Israel, 12 he-goats, according to the number of Israel's tribes. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The returned exiles kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 

<sup>20</sup> 

For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they killed the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their brother priests, and for themselves. 

<sup>21</sup> 

It was eaten by the Israelites who had returned from exile and by all who had joined them and separated themselves from the pollutions of the peoples of the land to seek the Lord, the God of Israel. 

<sup>22</sup> 

They kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, for the Lord had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria [referring to Darius king of Persia] to them, so that he strengthened their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
