And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then said I, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And behold, the angel who talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him, 

<sup>4</sup> 

And he said to the second angel, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited and dwell as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For I, says the Lord, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Ho! ho! [Hear and] flee from the land of the north, says the Lord, and from the four winds of the heavens, for to them have I scattered you, says the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Ho! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon! 

<sup>8</sup> 

For thus said the Lord of hosts, after [His] glory had sent me [His messenger] to the nations who plundered you--for he who touches you touches the apple or pupil of His eye: 

<sup>9</sup> 

Behold, I will swing my hand over them and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Sing and rejoice, O Daughter of Zion; for behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you, says the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that day and shall be My people. And I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know (recognize and understand) that the Lord of hosts has sent me [His messenger] to you. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the Lord shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land and shall again choose Jerusalem. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Be still, all flesh, before the Lord, for He is aroused and risen from His holy habitation.
