The men of Ephraim were summoned together and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, Why did you cross over to fight with the Ammonites and did not summon us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were in a severe conflict with the Ammonites, and I when I called you, you did not rescue me from their hands. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And when I saw that you would not rescue me, I put my life in my hands and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the Lord delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they had said, You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites; and when any of those Ephraimites who had escaped said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No, 

<sup>6</sup> 

They said to him, Then say Shibboleth; and he said, Sibboleth, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slew him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites.

Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he gave [to husbands] outside his tribe, and thirty daughters [daughters-in-law] whom he brought in from outside his tribe for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem. 

<sup>11</sup> 

After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And after him Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkey colts; and he judged Israel eight years. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then Abdon son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
