<sup>1</sup> 

After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the Lord, Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them? 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the Lord said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Judah [the tribe] said to [the tribe of] Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your territory. So Simeon went with him. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then Judah went up and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote 10,000 of them in Bezek. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off had to gather their food under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the men of Judah fought against [Jebusite] Jerusalem and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country, in the South (the Negeb), and in the lowland. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. The name of Hebron before was Kiriath-arba. And they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai. 

<sup>11</sup> 

From there [Judah] went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir before was Kiriath-sepher [city of books and scribes]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And Caleb said, Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah, my daughter, as wife. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah, his daughter, as wife. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And when she came to [Othniel], she got his consent to ask her father for a [sloping] field. And she alighted off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you want? 

<sup>15</sup> 

And she said to him, Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the South (the Negeb), give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the Judahites from the City of Palms (Jericho) into the Wilderness of Judah, which lies in the South (the Negeb) near Arad; and they went and dwelt with the people. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And [the tribe of] Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the city was called Hormah [destruction]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Also Judah took Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron--each with its territory. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The Lord was with Judah, and [Judah] drove out the inhabitants of the hill country, but he could not drive out those inhabiting the [difficult] valley basin because they had chariots of iron. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses said, and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But the Benjamites did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; the Jebusites dwell with the Benjamites in Jerusalem to this day. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And the house of Joseph was sent to spy out Bethel. The name of the city formerly had been Luz. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, Show us, we pray you, the way into the city and we will show you mercy. 

<sup>25</sup> 

When he showed them the entrance to the city, they smote the city with the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or of Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their villages, but the Canaanites remained in that land. 

<sup>28</sup> 

When Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor but did not utterly drive them out. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol, but the Canaanites dwelt among them and were put to forced labor. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob; 

<sup>32</sup> 

But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them. 

<sup>34</sup> 

The Amorites forced the Danites back into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down into the plain; 

<sup>35</sup> 

The Amorites remained fixed in Mount Heres [mountain of the sun], in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock Sela and onward.
