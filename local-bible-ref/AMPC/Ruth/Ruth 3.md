Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to Ruth, My daughter, shall I not seek rest or a home for you, that you may prosper? 

<sup>2</sup> 

And now is not Boaz, with whose maidens you were, our relative? See, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Wash and anoint yourself therefore, and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing floor, but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But when he lies down, notice the place where he lies; then go and uncover his feet and lie down. And he will tell you what to do. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And Ruth said to her, All that you say to me I will do. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. Then [Ruth] came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. 

<sup>8</sup> 

At midnight the man was startled, and he turned over, and behold, a woman lay at his feet! 

<sup>9</sup> 

And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your maidservant. Spread your wing [of protection] over your maidservant, for you are a next of kin. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And he said, Blessed be you of the Lord, my daughter. For you have made this last loving-kindness greater than the former, for you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And now, my daughter, fear not. I will do for you all you require, for all my people in the city know that you are a woman of strength (worth, bravery, capability). 

<sup>12</sup> 

It is true that I am your near kinsman; however, there is a kinsman nearer than I. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Remain tonight, and in the morning if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good; let him do it. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman for you, then, as the Lord lives, I will do the part of a kinsman for you. Lie down until the morning. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And she lay at his feet until the morning, but arose before one could recognize another; for he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Also he said, Bring the mantle you are wearing and hold it. So [Ruth] held it, and he measured out six measures of barley and laid it on her. And she went into the town. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And when she came home, her mother-in-law said, How have you fared, my daughter? And Ruth told her all that the man had done for her. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And she said, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, Do not go empty-handed to your mother-in-law. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he finishes the matter today.
