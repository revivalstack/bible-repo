In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. And the word was true and it referred to great tribulation (conflict and wretchedness). And he understood the word and had understanding of the vision. 

<sup>2</sup> 

In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three whole weeks. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I ate no pleasant or desirable food, nor did any meat or wine come into my mouth; and I did not anoint myself at all for the full three weeks. 

<sup>4</sup> 

On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was on the bank of the great river Hiddekel [which is the Tigris], 

<sup>5</sup> 

I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz. 

<sup>6</sup> 

His body also was [a golden luster] like beryl, his face had the appearance of lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and his feet like glowing burnished bronze, and the sound of his words was like the noise of a multitude [of people or the roaring of the sea]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision [of this heavenly being], for the men who were with me did not see the vision, but a great trembling fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves. 

<sup>8</sup> 

So I was left alone and saw this great vision, and no strength was left in me, for my fresh appearance was turned to pallor; I grew weak and faint [with fright]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then I heard the sound of his words; and when I heard the sound of his words, I fell on my face in a deep sleep, with my face [sunk] to the ground. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And behold, a hand touched me, which set me [unsteadily] upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And [the angel] said to me, O Daniel, you greatly beloved man, understand the words that I speak to you and stand upright, for to you I am now sent. And while he was saying this word to me, I stood up trembling. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then he said to me, Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your mind and heart to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come as a consequence of [and in response to] your words. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief [of the celestial] princes, came to help me, for I remained there with the kings of Persia. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Now I have come to make you understand what is to befall your people in the latter days, for the vision is for [many] days yet to come. 

<sup>15</sup> 

When he had spoken to me according to these words, I turned my face toward the ground and was dumb. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth and spoke. I said to him who stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision sorrows and pains have come upon me, and I retain no strength. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For how can my lord's servant [who is so feeble] talk with this my lord? For now no strength remains in me, nor is there any breath left in me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then there touched me again one whose appearance was like that of a man, and he strengthened me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not! Peace be to you! Be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened and said, Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then he said, Do you know why I have come to you? And now I will return to fight with the [hostile] prince of Persia; and when I have gone, behold, the [hostile] prince of Greece will come. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But I will tell you what is inscribed in the writing of truth or the Book of Truth. There is no one who holds with me and strengthens himself against these [hostile spirit forces] except Michael, your prince [national guardian angel].
