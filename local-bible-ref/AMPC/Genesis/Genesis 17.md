When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, I am the Almighty God; walk and live habitually before Me and be perfect (blameless, wholehearted, complete). 

<sup>2</sup> 

And I will make My covenant (solemn pledge) between Me and you and will multiply you exceedingly. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then Abram fell on his face, and God said to him, 

<sup>4</sup> 

As for Me, behold, My covenant (solemn pledge) is with you, and you shall be the father of many nations. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Nor shall your name any longer be Abram [high, exalted father]; but your name shall be Abraham [father of a multitude], for I have made you the father of many nations. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting, solemn pledge, to be a God to you and to your posterity after you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And I will give to you and to your posterity after you the land in which you are a stranger [going from place to place], all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And God said to Abraham, As for you, you shall therefore keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. 

<sup>10</sup> 

This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you and your posterity after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token or sign of the covenant (the promise or pledge) between Me and you. 

<sup>12</sup> 

He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised, every male throughout your generations, whether born in [your] house or bought with [your] money from any foreigner not of your offspring. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He that is born in your house and he that is bought with your money must be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the male who is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai; but Sarah [Princess] her name shall be. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And I will bless her and give you a son also by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a son? 

<sup>18</sup> 

And [he] said to God, Oh, that Ishmael might live before You! 

<sup>19</sup> 

But God said, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed, and you shall call his name Isaac [laughter]; and I will establish My covenant or solemn pledge with him for an everlasting covenant and with his posterity after him. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And as for Ishmael, I have heard and heeded you: behold, I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation. [Fulfilled in Gen. 25:12-18.] 

<sup>21</sup> 

But My covenant, My promise and pledge, I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this season next year. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And God stopped talking with him and went up from Abraham. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And Abraham took Ishmael his son and all who were born in his house and all who were bought with his money, every male among [those] of Abraham's house, and circumcised [them] the very same day, as God had said to him. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised. 

<sup>26</sup> 

On the very same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son as well. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And all the men of his house, both those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised along with him.
