Sarah lived 127 years; this was the length of the life of Sarah. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Abraham stood up from before his dead and said to the sons of Heth, 

<sup>4</sup> 

I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me property for a burial place among you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the Hittites replied to Abraham, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Listen to us, my lord; you are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in any tomb or grave of ours that you choose; none of us will withhold from you his tomb or hinder you from burying your dead. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, the Hittites. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And he said to them, If you are willing to grant my dead a burial out of my sight, listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar for me, 

<sup>9</sup> 

That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he owns--it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me here in your presence as a burial place to which I may hold fast among you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Now Ephron was present there among the sons of Heth; so, in the hearing of all who went in at the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, saying, 

<sup>11</sup> 

No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and the cave that is in it I give you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And he said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, But if you will give it, I beg of you, hear me. I will give you the price of the field; accept it from me, and I will bury my dead there. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Ephron replied to Abraham, saying, 

<sup>15</sup> 

My lord, listen to me. The land is worth 400 shekels of silver; what is that between you and me? So bury your dead. 

<sup>16</sup> 

So Abraham listened to what Ephron said and acted upon it. He weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: 400 shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre [Hebron]--the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field and in all its borders round about--was made over 

<sup>18</sup> 

As a possession to Abraham in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at his city gate. 

<sup>19</sup> 

After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The field and the cave in it were conveyed to Abraham for a permanent burial place by the sons of Heth.
