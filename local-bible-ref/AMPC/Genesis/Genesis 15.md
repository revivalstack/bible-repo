After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am your Shield, your abundant compensation, and your reward shall be exceedingly great. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Abram said, Lord God, what can You give me, since I am going on [from this world] childless and he who shall be the owner and heir of my house is this [steward] Eliezer of Damascus? 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Abram continued, Look, You have given me no child; and [a servant] born in my house is my heir. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, This man shall not be your heir, but he who shall come from your own body shall be your heir. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And He brought him outside [his tent into the starlight] and said, Look now toward the heavens and count the stars--if you are able to number them. Then He said to him, So shall your descendants be. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And he [Abram] believed in (trusted in, relied on, remained steadfast to) the Lord, and He counted it to him as righteousness (right standing with God). 

<sup>7</sup> 

And He said to him, I am the [same] Lord, Who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees to give you this land as an inheritance. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But he [Abram] said, Lord God, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it? 

<sup>9</sup> 

And He said to him, Bring to Me a heifer three years old, a she-goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And he brought Him all these and cut them down the middle [into halves] and laid each half opposite the other; but the birds he did not divide. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And when the birds of prey swooped down upon the carcasses, Abram drove them away. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When the sun was setting, a deep sleep overcame Abram, and a horror (a terror, a shuddering fear) of great darkness assailed and oppressed him. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And [God] said to Abram, Know positively that your descendants will be strangers dwelling as temporary residents in a land that is not theirs [Egypt], and they will be slaves there and will be afflicted and oppressed for 400 years. [Fulfilled in Exod. 12:40.] 

<sup>14</sup> 

But I will bring judgment on that nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old (hoary) age. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And in the fourth generation they [your descendants] shall come back here [to Canaan] again, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full and complete. 

<sup>17</sup> 

When the sun had gone down and a [thick] darkness had come on, behold, a smoking oven and a flaming torch passed between those pieces. 

<sup>18</sup> 

On the same day the Lord made a covenant (promise, pledge) with Abram, saying, To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates--the land of 

<sup>19</sup> 

The Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 

<sup>20</sup> 

The Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, 

<sup>21</sup> 

The Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
