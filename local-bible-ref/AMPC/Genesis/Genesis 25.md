<sup>1</sup> 

Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But to the sons of his concubines [Hagar and Keturah] Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them to the east country, away from Isaac his son [of promise]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The days of Abraham's life were 175 years. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then Abraham's spirit was released, and he died at a good (ample, full) old age, an old man, satisfied and satiated, and was gathered to his people. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre, 

<sup>10</sup> 

The field which Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 

<sup>11</sup> 

After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi [A well to the Living One Who sees me]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Now this is the history of the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham. 

<sup>13</sup> 

These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their births: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 

<sup>16</sup> 

These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments (sheepfolds)--twelve princes according to their tribes. [Foretold in Gen. 17:20.] 

<sup>17</sup> 

And Ishmael lived 137 years; then his spirit left him, and he died and was gathered to his kindred. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And [Ishmael's sons] dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is before Egypt in the direction of Assyria. [Ishmael] dwelt close [to the lands] of all his brethren. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And this is the history of the descendants of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham was the father of Isaac. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Padan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And Isaac prayed much to the Lord for his wife because she was unable to bear children; and the Lord granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife became pregnant. 

<sup>22</sup> 

[Two] children struggled together within her; and she said, If it is so [that the Lord has heard our prayer], why am I like this? And she went to inquire of the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The Lord said to her, [The founders of] two nations are in your womb, and the separation of two peoples has begun in your body; the one people shall be stronger than the other, and the elder shall serve the younger. 

<sup>24</sup> 

When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The first came out red all over like a hairy garment, and they named him Esau [hairy]. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Afterward his brother came forth, and his hand grasped Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob [supplanter]. Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them. 

<sup>27</sup> 

When the boys grew up, Esau was a cunning and skilled hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob was a plain and quiet man, dwelling in tents. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And Isaac loved [and was partial to] Esau, because he ate of Esau's game; but Rebekah loved Jacob. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Jacob was boiling pottage (lentil stew) one day, when Esau came from the field and was faint [with hunger]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And Esau said to Jacob, I beg of you, let me have some of that red lentil stew to eat, for I am faint and famished! That is why his name was called Edom [red]. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Jacob answered, Then sell me today your birthright (the rights of a firstborn). 

<sup>32</sup> 

Esau said, See here, I am at the point of death; what good can this birthright do me? 

<sup>33</sup> 

Jacob said, Swear to me today [that you are selling it to me]; and he swore to [Jacob] and sold him his birthright. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Then Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils, and he ate and drank and rose up and went his way. Thus Esau scorned his birthright as beneath his notice.
