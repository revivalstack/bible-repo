<sup>1</sup> 

So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South [country of Judah, the Negeb]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And he journeyed on from the South [country of Judah, the Negeb] as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Where he had built an altar at first; and there Abram called on the name of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Now the land was not able to nourish and support them so they could dwell together, for their possessions were too great for them to live together. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land [making fodder more difficult to obtain]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

So Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I beg of you, between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are relatives. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself, I beg of you, from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right hand, then I will go to the left. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And Lot looked and saw that everywhere the Jordan Valley was well watered. Before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, [it was all] like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Then Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley and [he] traveled east. So they separated. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the [Jordan] Valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom and dwelt there. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But the men of Sodom were wicked and exceedingly great sinners against the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The Lord said to Abram after Lot had left him, Lift up now your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward; 

<sup>15</sup> 

For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your posterity forever. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the dust of the earth, then could your descendants also be counted. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Arise, walk through the land, the length of it and the breadth of it, for I will give it to you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt among the oaks or terebinths of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and built there an altar to the Lord.
