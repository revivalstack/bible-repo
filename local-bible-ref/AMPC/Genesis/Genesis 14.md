<sup>1</sup> 

In the days of the kings Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim, 

<sup>2</sup> 

They made war on the kings Bera of Sodom, Birsha of Gomorrah, Shinab of Admah, Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that is, Zoar. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The latter kings joined together [as allies] in the Valley of Siddim, which is [now] the [Dead] Sea of Salt. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him attacked and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the Horites in their Mount Seir as far as El-paran, which is on the border of the wilderness. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat, which [now] is Kadesh, and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela, that is, Zoar, went out and [together] they joined battle [with those kings] in the Valley of Siddim, 

<sup>9</sup> 

With the kings Chedorlaomer of Elam, Tidal of Goiim, Amraphel of Shinar, and Arioch of Ellasar--four kings against five. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Now the Valley of Siddim was full of slime or bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell (were overthrown) there and the remainder [of the kings] fled to the mountain. 

<sup>11</sup> 

[The victors] took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah and all the supply of provisions and departed. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And they also took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods away with them. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew [one from the other side], who was living by the oaks or terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and of Aner--these were allies of Abram. 

<sup>14</sup> 

When Abram heard that [his nephew] had been captured, he armed (led forth) the 318 trained servants born in his own house and pursued the enemy as far as Dan. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and attacked and routed them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he brought back all the goods and also brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions, the women also and the people. 

<sup>17</sup> 

After his [Abram's] return from the defeat and slaying of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh, that is, the King's Valley. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Melchizedek king of Salem [later called Jerusalem] brought out bread and wine [for their nourishment]; he was the priest of God Most High, 

<sup>19</sup> 

And he blessed him and said, Blessed (favored with blessings, made blissful, joyful) be Abram by God Most High, Possessor and Maker of heaven and earth, 

<sup>20</sup> 

And blessed, praised, and glorified be God Most High, Who has given your foes into your hand! And [Abram] gave him a tenth of all [he had taken]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the persons and keep the goods for yourself. 

<sup>22</sup> 

But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand and sworn to the Lord, God Most High, the Possessor and Maker of heaven and earth, 

<sup>23</sup> 

That I would not take a thread or a shoelace or anything that is yours, lest you should say, I have made Abram rich. 

<sup>24</sup> 

[Take all] except only what my young men have eaten and the share of the men [allies] who went with me--Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
