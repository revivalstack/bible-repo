<sup>1</sup> 

And Adam knew Eve as his wife, and she became pregnant and bore Cain; and she said, I have gotten and gained a man with the help of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And [next] she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And in the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruit of the ground. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Abel brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat portions. And the Lord had respect and regard for Abel and for his offering, 

<sup>5</sup> 

But for Cain and his offering He had no respect or regard. So Cain was exceedingly angry and indignant, and he looked sad and depressed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the Lord said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why do you look sad and depressed and dejected? 

<sup>7</sup> 

If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you, but you must master it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And Cain said to his brother, Let us go out to the field. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the Lord said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper? 

<sup>10</sup> 

And [the Lord] said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to Me from the ground. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And now you are cursed by reason of the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's [shed] blood from your hand. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth [in perpetual exile, a degraded outcast]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the land, and from Your face I will be hidden; and I will be a fugitive and a vagabond and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the Lord said to him, Therefore, if anyone kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark or sign upon Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him. 

<sup>16</sup> 

So Cain went away from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod [wandering], east of Eden. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And Cain's wife [one of Adam's offspring] became pregnant and bore Enoch; and Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch. 

<sup>18</sup> 

To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methusael, and Methusael the father of Lamech. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah and of the other was Zillah. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle and purchase possessions. 

<sup>21</sup> 

His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all [cutting] instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say; for I have slain a man [merely] for wounding me, and a young man [only] for striking and bruising me. 

<sup>24</sup> 

If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech [will be avenged] seventy-sevenfold. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And Adam's wife again became pregnant, and she bore a son and called his name Seth. For God, she said, has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And to Seth also a son was born, whom he named Enosh. At that time men began to call [upon God] by the name of the Lord.
