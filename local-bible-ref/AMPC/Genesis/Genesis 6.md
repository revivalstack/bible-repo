<sup>1</sup> 

When men began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, 

<sup>2</sup> 

The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair, and they took wives of all they desired and chose. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then the Lord said, My Spirit shall not forever dwell and strive with man, for he also is flesh; but his days shall yet be 120 years. 

<sup>4</sup> 

There were giants on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God lived with the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination and intention of all human thinking was only evil continually. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved at heart. 

<sup>7</sup> 

So the Lord said, I will destroy, blot out, and wipe away mankind, whom I have created from the face of the ground--not only man, [but] the beasts and the creeping things and the birds of the air--for it grieves Me and makes Me regretful that I have made them. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But Noah found grace (favor) in the eyes of the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

This is the history of the generations of Noah. Noah was a just and righteous man, blameless in his [evil] generation; Noah walked [in habitual fellowship] with God. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The earth was depraved and putrid in God's sight, and the land was filled with violence (desecration, infringement, outrage, assault, and lust for power). 

<sup>12</sup> 

And God looked upon the world and saw how degenerate, debased, and vicious it was, for all humanity had corrupted their way upon the earth and lost their true direction. 

<sup>13</sup> 

God said to Noah, I intend to make an end of all flesh, for through men the land is filled with violence; and behold, I will destroy them and the land. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Make yourself an ark of gopher or cypress wood; make in it rooms (stalls, pens, coops, nests, cages, and compartments) and cover it inside and out with pitch (bitumen). 

<sup>15</sup> 

And this is the way you are to make it: the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits [that is, 450 ft. x 75 ft. x 45 ft.]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

You shall make a roof or window [a place for light] for the ark and finish it to a cubit [at least 18 inches] above--and the door of the ark you shall put in the side of it; and you shall make it with lower, second, and third stories. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For behold, I, even I, will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy and make putrid all flesh under the heavens in which are the breath and spirit of life; everything that is on the land shall die. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But I will establish My covenant (promise, pledge) with you, and you shall come into the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And of every living thing of all flesh [found on land], you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Of fowls and birds according to their kinds, of beasts according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind--two of every sort shall come in with you, that they may be kept alive. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and you shall collect and store it up, and it shall serve as food for you and for them. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.
