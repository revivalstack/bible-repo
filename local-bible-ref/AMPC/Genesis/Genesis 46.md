<sup>1</sup> 

So Israel made his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba [a place hallowed by sacred memories] and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night, and said, Jacob! Jacob! And he said, Here am I. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And He said, I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will there make of you a great nation. 

<sup>4</sup> 

I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you [your people Israel] up again; and Joseph will put his hand upon your eyes [when they are about to close in death]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

So Jacob arose and set out from Beersheba, and Israel's sons conveyed their father, their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And they took their cattle and the gains which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him: 

<sup>7</sup> 

His sons and his sons' sons with him, his daughters and his sons' daughters--all his offspring he brought with him into Egypt. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And these are the names of the descendants of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 

<sup>15</sup> 

These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-aram, together with his daughter Dinah. All of his sons and his daughters numbered thirty-three. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 

<sup>18</sup> 

These are the sons of Zilpah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob--sixteen persons all told. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 

<sup>22</sup> 

These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob--fourteen persons in all. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The son of Dan: Hushim. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 

<sup>25</sup> 

These are the sons of Bilhah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter. And she bore these to Jacob--seven persons in all. 

<sup>26</sup> 

All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt--who were his own offspring, not counting the wives of Jacob's sons--were sixty-six persons all told. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two persons. All the persons of the house of Jacob [including Joseph and Jacob himself], who came into Egypt, were seventy. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And he sent Judah before him to Joseph, to direct him to Goshen and meet him there; and they came into the land of Goshen. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Then Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; and he presented himself and gave distinct evidence of himself to him [that he was Joseph], and [each] fell on the [other's] neck and wept on his neck a good while. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And Israel said to Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen your face [and know] that you are still alive. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, I will go up and tell Pharaoh and say to him, My brothers and my father's household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me. 

<sup>32</sup> 

And the men are shepherds, for their occupation has been keeping livestock, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have. 

<sup>33</sup> 

When Pharaoh calls you and says, What is your occupation? 

<sup>34</sup> 

You shall say, Your servants' occupation has been as keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we and our fathers before us--in order that you may live in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.
