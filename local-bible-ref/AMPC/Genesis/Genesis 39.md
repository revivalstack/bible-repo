<sup>1</sup> 

And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain and chief executioner of the [royal] guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 

<sup>2</sup> 

But the Lord was with Joseph, and he [though a slave] was a successful and prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to flourish and succeed in his hand. 

<sup>4</sup> 

So Joseph pleased [Potiphar] and found favor in his sight, and he served him. And [his master] made him supervisor over his house and he put all that he had in his charge. 

<sup>5</sup> 

From the time that he made him supervisor in his house and over all that he had, the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the Lord's blessing was on all that he had in the house and in the field. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And [Potiphar] left all that he had in Joseph's charge and paid no attention to anything he had except the food he ate. Now Joseph was an attractive person and fine-looking. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, Lie with me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But he refused and said to his master's wife, See here, with me in the house my master has concern about nothing; he has put all that he has in my care. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept anything from me except you, for you are his wife. How then can I do this great evil and sin against God? 

<sup>10</sup> 

She spoke to Joseph day after day, but he did not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Then it happened about this time that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the men of the house were indoors. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me! But he left his garment in her hand and fled and got out [of the house]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled away, 

<sup>14</sup> 

She called to the men of her household and said to them, Behold, he [your master] has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock and insult us; he came in where I was to lie with me, and I screamed at the top of my voice. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And when he heard me screaming and crying, he left his garment with me and fled and got out of the house. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And she laid up his garment by her until his master came home. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then she told him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you brought among us came to me to mock and insult me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And when I screamed and cried, he left his garment with me and fled out [of the house]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And when [Joseph's] master heard the words of his wife, saying to him, This is the way your servant treated me, his wrath was kindled. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And Joseph's master took him and put him in the prison, a place where the state prisoners were confined; so he was there in the prison. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But the Lord was with Joseph, and showed him mercy and loving-kindness and gave him favor in the sight of the warden of the prison. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And the warden of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatsoever was done there, he was in charge of it. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The prison warden paid no attention to anything that was in [Joseph's] charge, for the Lord was with him and made whatever he did to prosper.
