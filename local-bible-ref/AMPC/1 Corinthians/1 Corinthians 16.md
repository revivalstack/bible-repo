<sup>1</sup> 

Now concerning the money contributed for [the relief of] the saints (God's people): you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do. 

<sup>2</sup> 

On the first [day] of each week, let each one of you [personally] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [in proportion to what he is given], so that no collections will need to be taken after I come. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And when I arrive, I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [of charity] to Jerusalem. 

<sup>4</sup> 

If it seems worthwhile that I should go too, they will accompany me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

After passing through Macedonia, I will visit you, for I intend [only] to pass through Macedonia; 

<sup>6</sup> 

But it may be that I will stay with you [for a while], perhaps even spend the winter, so that you may bring me forward [on my journey] to wherever I may go. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For I am unwilling to see you right now [just] in passing, but I hope later to remain for some time with you, if the Lord permits. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I will remain in Ephesus [however] until Pentecost, 

<sup>9</sup> 

For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [service] has opened to me [there, a great and promising one], and [there are] many adversaries. 

<sup>10</sup> 

When Timothy arrives, see to it that [you put him at ease, so that] he may be fearless among you, for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord's work, just as I am. 

<sup>11</sup> 

So [see to it that] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him. But send him off [cordially, speed him on his way] in peace, that he may come to me, for I am expecting him [to come along] with the other brethren. 

<sup>12</sup> 

As for our brother Apollos, I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will or God's will that he should go now. He will come when he has opportunity. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Be alert and on your guard; stand firm in your faith (your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it). Act like men and be courageous; grow in strength! 

<sup>14</sup> 

Let everything you do be done in love (true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us). 

<sup>15</sup> 

Now, brethren, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia (most of Greece), and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints (God's people). 

<sup>16</sup> 

I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them, as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [with you] and labors earnestly. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [to me], for they have made up for your absence. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For they gave me respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church [that meets] in their house, send you their hearty greetings in the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> 

All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

<sup>21</sup> 

I, Paul, [add this final] greeting with my own hand. 

<sup>22</sup> 

If anyone does not love the Lord [does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him], he shall be accursed! Our Lord will come! (Maranatha!) 

<sup>23</sup> 

The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

<sup>24</sup> 

My love (that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God) be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen (so be it).
