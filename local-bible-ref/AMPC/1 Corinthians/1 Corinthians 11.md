<sup>1</sup> 

Pattern yourselves after me [follow my example], as I imitate and follow Christ (the Messiah). 

<sup>2</sup> 

I appreciate and commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions (the substance of my instructions), just as I have [verbally] passed them on to you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But I want you to know and realize that Christ is the Head of every man, the head of a woman is her husband, and the Head of Christ is God. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Any man who prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, and comforts) with his head covered dishonors his Head (Christ). 

<sup>5</sup> 

And any woman who [publicly] prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, or comforts) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head (her husband); it is the same as [if her head were] shaved. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For if a woman will not wear [a head] covering, then she should cut off her hair too; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven, let her cover [her head]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For a man ought not to wear anything on his head [in church], for he is the image and [reflected] glory of God [his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule]; but woman is [the expression of] man's glory (majesty, preeminence). 

<sup>8</sup> 

For man was not [created] from woman, but woman from man; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Neither was man created on account of or for the benefit of woman, but woman on account of and for the benefit of man. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Therefore she should [be subject to his authority and should] have a covering on her head [as a token, a symbol, of her submission to authority, that she may show reverence as do] the angels [and not displease them]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Nevertheless, in [the plan of] the Lord and from His point of view woman is not apart from and independent of man, nor is man aloof from and independent of woman; 

<sup>12</sup> 

For as woman was made from man, even so man is also born of woman; and all [whether male or female go forth] from God [as their Author]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Consider for yourselves; is it proper and decent [according to your customs] for a woman to offer prayer to God [publicly] with her head uncovered? 

<sup>14</sup> 

Does not the native sense of propriety (experience, common sense, reason) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor [humiliating and degrading] to him, 

<sup>15</sup> 

But if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament and glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative and contentious about this, we hold to and recognize no other custom [in worship] than this, nor do the churches of God generally. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But in what I instruct [you] next I do not commend [you], because when you meet together, it is not for the better but for the worse. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For in the first place, when you assemble as a congregation, I hear that there are cliques (divisions and factions) among you; and I in part believe it, 

<sup>19</sup> 

For doubtless there have to be factions or parties among you in order that they who are genuine and of approved fitness may become evident and plainly recognized among you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So when you gather for your meetings, it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat, 

<sup>21</sup> 

For in eating each one [hurries] to get his own supper first [not waiting for the poor], and one goes hungry while another gets drunk. 

<sup>22</sup> 

What! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and mean to show contempt for it, while you humiliate those who are poor (have no homes and have brought no food)? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, [most certainly] I will not! 

<sup>23</sup> 

For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you [it was given to me personally], that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up and while His betrayal was in progress took bread, 

<sup>24</sup> 

And when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and said, Take, eat. This is My body, which is broken for you. Do this to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Similarly when supper was ended, He took the cup also, saying, This cup is the new covenant [ratified and established] in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink [it], to call Me [affectionately] to remembrance. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are representing and signifying and proclaiming the fact of the Lord's death until He comes [again]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy [of Him] will be guilty of [profaning and sinning against] the body and blood of the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Let a man [thoroughly] examine himself, and [only when he has done] so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 

<sup>29</sup> 

For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [it is Christ's] body, eats and drinks a sentence (a verdict of judgment) upon himself. 

<sup>30</sup> 

That [careless and unworthy participation] is the reason many of you are weak and sickly, and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For if we searchingly examined ourselves [detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition], we should not be judged and penalty decreed [by the divine judgment]. 

<sup>32</sup> 

But when we [fall short and] are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined and chastened, so that we may not [finally] be condemned [to eternal punishment along] with the world. 

<sup>33</sup> 

So then, my brothers, when you gather together to eat [the Lord's Supper], wait for one another. 

<sup>34</sup> 

If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together to bring judgment [on yourselves]. About the other matters, I will give you directions [personally] when I come.
