Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the fish's belly, 

<sup>2</sup> 

And said, I cried out of my distress to the Lord, and He heard me; out of the belly of Sheol cried I, and You heard my voice. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the floods surrounded me; all Your waves and Your billows passed over me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then I said, I have been cast out of Your presence and Your sight; yet I will look again toward Your holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The waters compassed me about, even to [the extinction of] life; the abyss surrounded me, the seaweed was wrapped about my head. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I went down to the bottoms and the very roots of the mountains; the earth with its bars closed behind me forever. Yet You have brought up my life from the pit and corruption, O Lord my God. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When my soul fainted upon me [crushing me], I earnestly and seriously remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to You, into Your holy temple. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Those who pay regard to false, useless, and worthless idols forsake their own [Source of] mercy and loving-kindness. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But as for me, I will sacrifice to You with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation and deliverance belong to the Lord! 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
