And the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and preach and cry out to it the preaching that I tell you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

So Jonah arose and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city of three days' journey [sixty miles in circumference]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown! 

<sup>5</sup> 

So the people of Nineveh believed in God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth [in penitent mourning], from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For word came to the king of Nineveh [of all that had happened to Jonah, and his terrifying message from God], and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe aside, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh, By the decree of the king and his nobles: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed nor drink water. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and let them cry mightily to God. Yes, let every one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who can tell, God may turn and revoke His sentence against us [when we have met His terms], and turn away from His fierce anger so that we perish not. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God revoked His [sentence of] evil that He had said that He would do to them and He did not do it [for He was comforted and eased concerning them].
