Now after the Sabbath, near dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the boulder back and sat upon it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

His appearance was like lightning, and his garments as white as snow. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And those keeping guard were so frightened at the sight of him that they were agitated and they trembled and became like dead men. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But the angel said to the women, Do not be alarmed and frightened, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, Who was crucified. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He is not here; He has risen, as He said [He would do]. Come, see the place where He lay. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then go quickly and tell His disciples, He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

So they left the tomb hastily with fear and great joy and ran to tell the disciples. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And as they went, behold, Jesus met them and said, Hail (greetings)! And they went up to Him and clasped His feet and worshiped Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then Jesus said to them, Do not be alarmed and afraid; go and tell My brethren to go into Galilee, and there they will see Me. 

<sup>11</sup> 

While they were on their way, behold, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had occurred. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And when they [the chief priests] had gathered with the elders and had consulted together, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers, 

<sup>13</sup> 

And said, Tell people, His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And if the governor hears of it, we will appease him and make you safe and free from trouble and care. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been current among the Jews to the present day. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed and made appointment with them. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And when they saw Him, they fell down and worshiped Him; but some doubted. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Jesus approached and, breaking the silence, said to them, All authority (all power of rule) in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Go then and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

<sup>20</sup> 

Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days (perpetually, uniformly, and on every occasion), to the [very] close and consummation of the age. Amen (so let it be).
