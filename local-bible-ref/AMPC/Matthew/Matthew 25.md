<sup>1</sup> 

Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Five of them were foolish (thoughtless, without forethought) and five were wise (sensible, intelligent, and prudent). 

<sup>3</sup> 

For when the foolish took their lamps, they did not take any [extra] oil with them; 

<sup>4</sup> 

But the wise took flasks of oil along with them [also] with their lamps. 

<sup>5</sup> 

While the bridegroom lingered and was slow in coming, they all began nodding their heads, and they fell asleep. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But at midnight there was a shout, Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to meet him! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then all those virgins got up and put their own lamps in order. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But the wise replied, There will not be enough for us and for you; go instead to the dealers and buy for yourselves. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were prepared went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Later the other virgins also came and said, Lord, Lord, open [the door] to us! 

<sup>12</sup> 

But He replied, I solemnly declare to you, I do not know you [I am not acquainted with you]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Watch therefore [give strict attention and be cautious and active], for you know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For it is like a man who was about to take a long journey, and he called his servants together and entrusted them with his property. 

<sup>15</sup> 

To one he gave five talents [probably about $5,000], to another two, to another one--to each in proportion to his own personal ability. Then he departed and left the country. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he gained five talents more. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And likewise he who had received the two talents--he also gained two talents more. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But he who had received the one talent went and dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Now after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And he who had received the five talents came and brought him five more, saying, Master, you entrusted to me five talents; see, here I have gained five talents more. 

<sup>21</sup> 

His master said to him, Well done, you upright (honorable, admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight, the blessedness) which your master enjoys. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, Master, you entrusted two talents to me; here I have gained two talents more. 

<sup>23</sup> 

His master said to him, Well done, you upright (honorable, admirable) and faithful servant! You have been faithful and trustworthy over a little; I will put you in charge of much. Enter into and share the joy (the delight, the blessedness) which your master enjoys. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He who had received one talent also came forward, saying, Master, I knew you to be a harsh and hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you had not winnowed [the grain]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

So I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is your own. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But his master answered him, You wicked and lazy and idle servant! Did you indeed know that I reap where I have not sowed and gather [grain] where I have not winnowed? 

<sup>27</sup> 

Then you should have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received what was my own with interest. 

<sup>28</sup> 

So take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. 

<sup>29</sup> 

For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will be furnished richly so that he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he does have will be taken away. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And throw the good-for-nothing servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. 

<sup>31</sup> 

When the Son of Man comes in His glory (His majesty and splendor), and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 

<sup>32</sup> 

All nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them [the people] from one another as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats; 

<sup>33</sup> 

And He will cause the sheep to stand at His right hand, but the goats at His left. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Then the King will say to those at His right hand, Come, you blessed of My Father [you favored of God and appointed to eternal salvation], inherit (receive as your own) the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 

<sup>35</sup> 

For I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink, I was a stranger and you brought Me together with yourselves and welcomed and entertained and lodged Me, 

<sup>36</sup> 

I was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me with help and ministering care, I was in prison and you came to see Me. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Then the just and upright will answer Him, Lord, when did we see You hungry and gave You food, or thirsty and gave You something to drink? 

<sup>38</sup> 

And when did we see You a stranger and welcomed and entertained You, or naked and clothed You? 

<sup>39</sup> 

And when did we see You sick or in prison and came to visit You? 

<sup>40</sup> 

And the King will reply to them, Truly I tell you, in so far as you did it for one of the least [in the estimation of men] of these My brethren, you did it for Me. 

<sup>41</sup> 

Then He will say to those at His left hand, Begone from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels! 

<sup>42</sup> 

For I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink, 

<sup>43</sup> 

I was a stranger and you did not welcome Me and entertain Me, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me with help and ministering care. 

<sup>44</sup> 

Then they also [in their turn] will answer, Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You? 

<sup>45</sup> 

And He will reply to them, Solemnly I declare to you, in so far as you failed to do it for the least [in the estimation of men] of these, you failed to do it for Me. 

<sup>46</sup> 

Then they will go away into eternal punishment, but those who are just and upright and in right standing with God into eternal life.
