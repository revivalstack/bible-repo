After this [Paul] departed from Athens and went to Corinth. 

<sup>2</sup> 

There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently arrived from Italy with Priscilla his wife, due to the fact that Claudius had issued an edict that all the Jews were to leave Rome. And [Paul] went to see them, 

<sup>3</sup> 

And because he was of the same occupation, he stayed with them; and they worked [together], for they were tentmakers by trade. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But he discoursed and argued in the synagogue every Sabbath and won over [both] Jews and Greeks. 

<sup>5</sup> 

By the time Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was completely engrossed with preaching, earnestly arguing and testifying to the Jews that Jesus [is] the Christ. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But since they kept opposing and abusing and reviling him, he shook out his clothing [against them] and said to them, Your blood be upon your [own] heads! I am innocent [of it]. From now on I will go to the Gentiles (the heathen). 

<sup>7</sup> 

He then left there and went to the house of a man named Titus Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed [that Jesus is the Messiah and acknowledged Him with joyful trust as Savior and Lord], together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians who listened [to Paul also] believed and were baptized. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And one night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, Have no fear, but speak and do not keep silent; 

<sup>10</sup> 

For I am with you, and no man shall assault you to harm you, for I have many people in this city. 

<sup>11</sup> 

So he settled down among them for a year and six months, teaching the Word of God [concerning the attainment through Christ of eternal salvation in the kingdom of God]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia (most of Greece), the Jews unitedly made an attack upon Paul and brought him before the judge's seat, 

<sup>13</sup> 

Declaring, This fellow is advising and inducing and inciting people to worship God in violation of the Law [of Rome and of Moses]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But when Paul was about to open his mouth to reply, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of some misdemeanor or villainy, O Jews, I should have cause to bear with you and listen; 

<sup>15</sup> 

But since it is merely a question [of doctrine] about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I decline to be a judge of such matters and I have no intention of trying such cases. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he drove them away from the judgment seat. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then they [the Greeks] all seized Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him right in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Afterward Paul remained many days longer, and then told the brethren farewell and sailed for Syria; and he was accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he [Paul] cut his hair, for he had made a vow. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then they arrived in Ephesus, and [Paul] left the others there; but he himself entered the synagogue and discoursed and argued with the Jews. 

<sup>20</sup> 

When they asked him to remain for a longer time, he would not consent; 

<sup>21</sup> 

But when he was leaving them he said, I will return to you if God is willing, and he set sail from Ephesus. 

<sup>22</sup> 

When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and saluted the church [at Jerusalem], and then went down to Antioch. 

<sup>23</sup> 

After staying there some time, he left and went from place to place in an orderly journey through the territory of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing the disciples and imparting new strength to them. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Meanwhile, there was a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, who came to Ephesus. He was a cultured and eloquent man, well versed and mighty in the Scriptures. 

<sup>25</sup> 

He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and burning with spiritual zeal, he spoke and taught diligently and accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he was acquainted only with the baptism of John. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He began to speak freely (fearlessly and boldly) in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him with them and expounded to him the way of God more definitely and accurately. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And when [Apollos] wished to cross to Achaia (most of Greece), the brethren wrote to the disciples there, urging and encouraging them to accept and welcome him heartily. When he arrived, he proved a great help to those who through grace (God's unmerited favor and mercy) had believed (adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Christ as Lord and Savior). 

<sup>28</sup> 

For with great power he refuted the Jews in public [discussions], showing and proving by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah).
