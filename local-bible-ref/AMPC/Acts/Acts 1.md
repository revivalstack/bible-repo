<sup>1</sup> 

In the former account [which I prepared], O Theophilus, I made [a continuous report] dealing with all the things which Jesus began to do and to teach 

<sup>2</sup> 

Until the day when He ascended, after He through the Holy Spirit had instructed and commanded the apostles (special messengers) whom He had chosen. 

<sup>3</sup> 

To them also He showed Himself alive after His passion (His suffering in the garden and on the cross) by [a series of] many convincing demonstrations [unquestionable evidences and infallible proofs], appearing to them during forty days and talking [to them] about the things of the kingdom of God. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And while being in their company and eating with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for what the Father had promised, Of which [He said] you have heard Me speak. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For John baptized with water, but not many days from now you shall be baptized with (placed in, introduced into) the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So when they were assembled, they asked Him, Lord, is this the time when You will reestablish the kingdom and restore it to Israel? 

<sup>7</sup> 

He said to them, It is not for you to become acquainted with and know what time brings [the things and events of time and their definite periods] or fixed years and seasons (their critical niche in time), which the Father has appointed (fixed and reserved) by His own choice and authority and personal power. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Samaria and to the ends (the very bounds) of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And when He had said this, even as they were looking [at Him], He was caught up, and a cloud received and carried Him away out of their sight. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And while they were gazing intently into heaven as He went, behold, two men [dressed] in white robes suddenly stood beside them, 

<sup>11</sup> 

Who said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, Who was caught away and lifted up from among you into heaven, will return in [just] the same way in which you saw Him go into heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then [the disciples] went back to Jerusalem from the hill called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, [only] a Sabbath day's journey (three-quarters of a mile) away. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And when they had entered [the city], they mounted [the stairs] to the upper room where they were [indefinitely] staying--Peter and John and James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas [son] of James. 

<sup>14</sup> 

All of these with their minds in full agreement devoted themselves steadfastly to prayer, [waiting together] with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Now on one of those days Peter arose among the brethren, the whole number of whom gathered together was about a hundred and twenty. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Brethren, he said, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit foretold by the lips of David, about Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For he was counted among us and received [by divine allotment] his portion in this ministry. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Now this man obtained a piece of land with the [money paid him as a] reward for his treachery and wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle [of his body] and all his intestines poured forth. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And all the residents of Jerusalem became acquainted with the facts, so that they called the piece of land in their own dialect--Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood. 

<sup>20</sup> 

For in the book of Psalms it is written, Let his place of residence become deserted and gloomy, and let there be no one to live in it; and [again], Let another take his position or overseership. 

<sup>21</sup> 

So one of the [other] men who have accompanied us [apostles] during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 

<sup>22</sup> 

From the baptism of John at the outset until the day when He was taken up from among us--one of these men must join with us and become a witness to testify to His resurrection. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And they accordingly proposed (nominated) two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And they prayed and said, You, Lord, Who know all hearts (their thoughts, passions, desires, appetites, purposes, and endeavors), indicate to us which one of these two You have chosen 

<sup>25</sup> 

To take the place in this ministry and receive the position of an apostle, from which Judas fell away and went astray to go [where he belonged] to his own [proper] place. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And they drew lots [between the two], and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to and counted with the eleven apostles (special messengers).
