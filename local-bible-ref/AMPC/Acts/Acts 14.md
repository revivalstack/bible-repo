Now at Iconium [also Paul and Barnabas] went into the Jewish synagogue together and spoke with such power that a great number both of Jews and of Greeks believed (became Christians); 

<sup>2</sup> 

But the unbelieving Jews [who rejected their message] aroused the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren. 

<sup>3</sup> 

So [Paul and Barnabas] stayed on there for a long time, speaking freely and fearlessly and boldly in the Lord, Who continued to bear testimony to the Word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But the residents of the town were divided, some siding with the Jews and some with the apostles. 

<sup>5</sup> 

When there was an attempt both on the part of the Gentiles and the Jews together with their rulers, to insult and abuse and molest [Paul and Barnabas] and to stone them, 

<sup>6</sup> 

They, aware of the situation, made their escape to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and the neighboring districts; 

<sup>7</sup> 

And there they continued to preach the glad tidings (Gospel). 

<sup>8</sup> 

Now at Lystra a man sat who found it impossible to use his feet, for he was a cripple from birth and had never walked. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He was listening to Paul as he talked, and [Paul] gazing intently at him and observing that he had faith to be healed, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Shouted at him, saying, Stand erect on your feet! And he leaped up and walked. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, shouting in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us in human form! 

<sup>12</sup> 

They called Barnabas Zeus, and they called Paul, because he led in the discourse, Hermes [god of speech]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And the priest of Zeus, whose [temple] was at the entrance of the town, brought bulls and garlands to the [city's] gates and wanted to join the people in offering sacrifice. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothing and dashed out among the crowd, shouting, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Men, why are you doing this? We also are [only] human beings, of nature like your own, and we bring you the good news (Gospel) that you should turn away from these foolish and vain things to the living God, Who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything that they contain. 

<sup>16</sup> 

In generations past He permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways; 

<sup>17</sup> 

Yet He did not neglect to leave some witness of Himself, for He did you good and [showed you] kindness and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with nourishment and happiness. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Even in [the light of] these words they with difficulty prevented the people from offering sacrifice to them. 

<sup>19</sup> 

But some Jews arrived there from Antioch and Iconium; and having persuaded the people and won them over, they stoned Paul and [afterward] dragged him out of the town, thinking that he was dead. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But the disciples formed a circle about him, and he got up and went back into the town; and on the morrow he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 

<sup>21</sup> 

When they had preached the good news (Gospel) to that town and made disciples of many of the people, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch, 

<sup>22</sup> 

Establishing and strengthening the souls and the hearts of the disciples, urging and warning and encouraging them to stand firm in the faith, and [telling them] that it is through many hardships and tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And when they had appointed and ordained elders for them in each church with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in Whom they had come to believe [being full of joyful trust that He is the Christ, the Messiah]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then they went through Pisidia and arrived at Pamphylia. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And when they had spoken the Word in Perga [the doctrine concerning the attainment through Christ of salvation in the kingdom of God], they went down to Attalia; 

<sup>26</sup> 

And from there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had [first] been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had [now] completed. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Arriving there, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had accomplished with them and how He had opened to the Gentiles a door of faith [in Jesus as the Messiah, through Whom we obtain salvation in the kingdom of God]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And there they stayed no little time with the disciples.
