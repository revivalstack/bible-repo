I appeal to you therefore, brethren, and beg of you in view of [all] the mercies of God, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice, holy (devoted, consecrated) and well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable (rational, intelligent) service and spiritual worship. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Do not be conformed to this world (this age), [fashioned after and adapted to its external, superficial customs], but be transformed (changed) by the [entire] renewal of your mind [by its new ideals and its new attitude], so that you may prove [for yourselves] what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect [in His sight for you]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For by the grace (unmerited favor of God) given to me I warn everyone among you not to estimate and think of himself more highly than he ought [not to have an exaggerated opinion of his own importance], but to rate his ability with sober judgment, each according to the degree of faith apportioned by God to him. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For as in one physical body we have many parts (organs, members) and all of these parts do not have the same function or use, 

<sup>5</sup> 

So we, numerous as we are, are one body in Christ (the Messiah) and individually we are parts one of another [mutually dependent on one another]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Having gifts (faculties, talents, qualities) that differ according to the grace given us, let us use them: [He whose gift is] prophecy, [let him prophesy] according to the proportion of his faith; 

<sup>7</sup> 

[He whose gift is] practical service, let him give himself to serving; he who teaches, to his teaching; 

<sup>8</sup> 

He who exhorts (encourages), to his exhortation; he who contributes, let him do it in simplicity and liberality; he who gives aid and superintends, with zeal and singleness of mind; he who does acts of mercy, with genuine cheerfulness and joyful eagerness. 

<sup>9</sup> 

[Let your] love be sincere (a real thing); hate what is evil [loathe all ungodliness, turn in horror from wickedness], but hold fast to that which is good. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Love one another with brotherly affection [as members of one family], giving precedence and showing honor to one another. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor; be aglow and burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Rejoice and exult in hope; be steadfast and patient in suffering and tribulation; be constant in prayer. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Contribute to the needs of God's people [sharing in the necessities of the saints]; pursue the practice of hospitality. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Bless those who persecute you [who are cruel in their attitude toward you]; bless and do not curse them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Rejoice with those who rejoice [sharing others' joy], and weep with those who weep [sharing others' grief]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty (snobbish, high-minded, exclusive), but readily adjust yourself to [people, things] and give yourselves to humble tasks. Never overestimate yourself or be wise in your own conceits. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is honest and proper and noble [aiming to be above reproach] in the sight of everyone. 

<sup>18</sup> 

If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave the way open for [God's] wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay (requite), says the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Do not let yourself be overcome by evil, but overcome (master) evil with good.
