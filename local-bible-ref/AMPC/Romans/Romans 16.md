<sup>1</sup> 

Now I introduce and commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae, 

<sup>2</sup> 

That you may receive her in the Lord [with a Christian welcome], as saints (God's people) ought to receive one another. And help her in whatever matter she may require assistance from you, for she has been a helper of many including myself [shielding us from suffering]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who risked their lives [endangering their very necks] for my life. To them not only I but also all the churches among the Gentiles give thanks. 

<sup>5</sup> 

[Remember me] also to the church [that meets] in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was a firstfruit (first convert) to Christ in Asia. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Greet Mary, who has worked so hard among you. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Remember me to Andronicus and Junias, my tribal kinsmen and once my fellow prisoners. They are men held in high esteem among the apostles, who also were in Christ before I was. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Remember me to Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Salute Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear Stachys. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Greet Apelles, that one tried and approved in Christ (the Messiah). Remember me to those who belong to the household of Aristobulus. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Greet my tribal kinsman Herodion, and those in the Lord who belong to the household of Narcissus. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Salute those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet my dear Persis, who has worked so hard in the Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Remember me to Rufus, eminent in the Lord, also to his mother [who has been] a mother to me as well. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brethren who are with them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Greet one another with a holy (consecrated) kiss. All the churches of Christ (the Messiah) wish to be remembered to you. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I appeal to you, brethren, to be on your guard concerning those who create dissensions and difficulties and cause divisions, in opposition to the doctrine (the teaching) which you have been taught. [I warn you to turn aside from them, to] avoid them. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ but their own appetites and base desires, and by ingratiating and flattering speech, they beguile the hearts of the unsuspecting and simpleminded [people]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

For while your loyalty and obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, I would have you well versed and wise as to what is good and innocent and guileless as to what is evil. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Timothy, my fellow worker, wishes to be remembered to you, as do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my tribal kinsmen. 

<sup>22</sup> 

I, Tertius, the writer of this letter, greet you in the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church here, greets you. So do Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it). 

<sup>25</sup> 

Now to Him Who is able to strengthen you in the faith which is in accordance with my Gospel and the preaching of (concerning) Jesus Christ (the Messiah), according to the revelation (the unveiling) of the mystery of the plan of redemption which was kept in silence and secret for long ages, 

<sup>26</sup> 

But is now disclosed and through the prophetic Scriptures is made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, [to win them] to obedience to the faith, 

<sup>27</sup> 

To [the] only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ (the Anointed One)! Amen (so be it).
