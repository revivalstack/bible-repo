<sup>1</sup> 

We who are strong [in our convictions and of robust faith] ought to bear with the failings and the frailties and the tender scruples of the weak; [we ought to help carry the doubts and qualms of others] and not to please ourselves. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let each one of us make it a practice to please (make happy) his neighbor for his good and for his true welfare, to edify him [to strengthen him and build him up spiritually]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For Christ did not please Himself [gave no thought to His own interests]; but, as it is written, The reproaches and abuses of those who reproached and abused you fell on Me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction, that by [our steadfast and patient] endurance and the encouragement [drawn] from the Scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Now may the God Who gives the power of patient endurance (steadfastness) and Who supplies encouragement, grant you to live in such mutual harmony and such full sympathy with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, 

<sup>6</sup> 

That together you may [unanimously] with united hearts and one voice, praise and glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 

<sup>7</sup> 

Welcome and receive [to your hearts] one another, then, even as Christ has welcomed and received you, for the glory of God. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For I tell you that Christ (the Messiah) became a servant and a minister to the circumcised (the Jews) in order to show God's truthfulness and honesty by confirming (verifying) the promises [given] to our fathers, 

<sup>9</sup> 

And [also in order] that the Gentiles (nations) might glorify God for His mercy [not covenanted] to them. As it is written, Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles and sing praises to Your name. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Again it is said, Rejoice (exult), O Gentiles, along with His [own] people; 

<sup>11</sup> 

And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise Him! 

<sup>12</sup> 

And further Isaiah says, There shall be a Sprout from the Root of Jesse, He Who rises to rule over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles hope. 

<sup>13</sup> 

May the God of your hope so fill you with all joy and peace in believing [through the experience of your faith] that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound and be overflowing (bubbling over) with hope. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Personally I am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are rich in goodness, amply filled with all [spiritual] knowledge and competent to admonish and counsel and instruct one another also. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Still on some points I have written to you the more boldly and unreservedly by way of reminder. [I have done so] because of the grace (the unmerited favor) bestowed on me by God 

<sup>16</sup> 

In making me a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I act in the priestly service of the Gospel (the good news) of God, in order that the sacrificial offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable [to God], consecrated and made holy by the Holy Spirit. 

<sup>17</sup> 

In Christ Jesus, then, I have legitimate reason to glory (exult) in my work for God [in what through Christ Jesus I have accomplished concerning the things of God]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For [of course] I will not venture (presume) to speak thus of any work except what Christ has actually done through me [as an instrument in His hands] to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed, 

<sup>19</sup> 

[Even as my preaching has been accompanied] with the power of signs and wonders, [and all of it] by the power of the Holy Spirit. [The result is] that starting from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum, I have fully preached the Gospel [faithfully executing, accomplishing, carrying out to the full the good news] of Christ (the Messiah) in its entirety. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Thus my ambition has been to preach the Gospel, not where Christ's name has already been known, lest I build on another man's foundation; 

<sup>21</sup> 

But [instead I would act on the principle] as it is written, They shall see who have never been told of Him, and they shall understand who have never heard [of Him]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

This [ambition] is the reason why I have so frequently been hindered from coming to visit you. 

<sup>23</sup> 

But now since I have no further opportunity for work in these regions, and since I have longed for enough years to come to you, 

<sup>24</sup> 

I hope to see you in passing [through Rome] as I go [on my intended trip] to Spain, and to be aided on my journey there by you, after I have enjoyed your company for a little while. 

<sup>25</sup> 

For the present, however, I am going to Jerusalem to bring aid (relief) for the saints (God's people there). 

<sup>26</sup> 

For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make some contribution for the poor among the saints of Jerusalem. 

<sup>27</sup> 

They were pleased to do it; and surely they are in debt to them, for if these Gentiles have come to share in their [the Jerusalem Jews'] spiritual blessings, then they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. 

<sup>28</sup> 

When therefore I have completed this mission and have delivered to them [at Jerusalem] what has been raised, I shall go on by way of you to Spain. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And I know that when I do come to you, I shall come in the abundant blessing of the Gospel of Christ. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I appeal to you [I entreat you], brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love [given by] the Spirit, to unite with me in earnest wrestling in prayer to God in my behalf. 

<sup>31</sup> 

[Pray] that I may be delivered (rescued) from the unbelievers in Judea and that my mission of relief to Jerusalem may be acceptable and graciously received by the saints (God's people there), 

<sup>32</sup> 

So that by God's will I may subsequently come to you with joy (with a happy heart) and be refreshed [by the interval of rest] in your company. 

<sup>33</sup> 

May [our] peace-giving God be with you all! Amen (so be it).
