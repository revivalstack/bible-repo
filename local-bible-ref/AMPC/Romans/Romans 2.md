<sup>1</sup> 

Therefore you have no excuse or defense or justification, O man, whoever you are who judges and condemns another. For in posing as judge and passing sentence on another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things [that you censure and denounce]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

[But] we know that the judgment (adverse verdict, sentence) of God falls justly and in accordance with truth upon those who practice such things. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And do you think or imagine, O man, when you judge and condemn those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape God's judgment and elude His sentence and adverse verdict? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Or are you [so blind as to] trifle with and presume upon and despise and underestimate the wealth of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering patience? Are you unmindful or actually ignorant [of the fact] that God's kindness is intended to lead you to repent (to change your mind and inner man to accept God's will)? 

<sup>5</sup> 

But by your callous stubbornness and impenitence of heart you are storing up wrath and indignation for yourself on the day of wrath and indignation, when God's righteous judgment (just doom) will be revealed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For He will render to every man according to his works [justly, as his deeds deserve]: 

<sup>7</sup> 

To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [springing from piety] seek [unseen but sure] glory and honor and [the eternal blessedness of] immortality, He will give eternal life. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But for those who are self-seeking and self-willed and disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness, there will be indignation and wrath. 

<sup>9</sup> 

[And] there will be tribulation and anguish and calamity and constraint for every soul of man who [habitually] does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile). 

<sup>10</sup> 

But glory and honor and [heart] peace shall be awarded to everyone who [habitually] does good, the Jew first and also the Greek (Gentile). 

<sup>11</sup> 

For God shows no partiality [undue favor or unfairness; with Him one man is not different from another]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

All who have sinned without the Law will also perish without [regard to] the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged and condemned by the Law. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For it is not merely hearing the Law [read] that makes one righteous before God, but it is the doers of the Law who will be held guiltless and acquitted and justified. 

<sup>14</sup> 

When Gentiles who have not the [divine] Law do instinctively what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, since they do not have the Law. 

<sup>15</sup> 

They show that the essential requirements of the Law are written in their hearts and are operating there, with which their consciences (sense of right and wrong) also bear witness; and their [moral] decisions (their arguments of reason, their condemning or approving thoughts) will accuse or perhaps defend and excuse [them] 

<sup>16</sup> 

On that day when, as my Gospel proclaims, God by Jesus Christ will judge men in regard to the things which they conceal (their hidden thoughts). 

<sup>17</sup> 

But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law and pride yourselves in God and your relationship to Him, 

<sup>18</sup> 

And know and understand His will and discerningly approve the better things and have a sense of what is vital, because you are instructed by the Law; 

<sup>19</sup> 

And if you are confident that you [yourself] are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, and [that 

<sup>20</sup> 

You are] a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the childish, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth-- 

<sup>21</sup> 

Well then, you who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you teach against stealing, do you steal (take what does not really belong to you)? 

<sup>22</sup> 

You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery [are you unchaste in action or in thought]? You who abhor and loathe idols, do you rob temples [do you appropriate to your own use what is consecrated to God, thus robbing the sanctuary and doing sacrilege]? 

<sup>23</sup> 

You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law [by stealthily infringing upon or carelessly neglecting or openly breaking it]? 

<sup>24</sup> 

For, as it is written, The name of God is maligned and blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you! [The words to this effect are from your own Scriptures.] 

<sup>25</sup> 

Circumcision does indeed profit if you keep the Law; but if you habitually transgress the Law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision. 

<sup>26</sup> 

So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the Law, will not his uncircumcision be credited to him as [equivalent to] circumcision? 

<sup>27</sup> 

Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the Law will condemn you who, although you have the code in writing and have circumcision, break the Law. 

<sup>28</sup> 

For he is not a [real] Jew who is only one outwardly and publicly, nor is [true] circumcision something external and physical. 

<sup>29</sup> 

But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and [true] circumcision is of the heart, a spiritual and not a literal [matter]. His praise is not from men but from God.
