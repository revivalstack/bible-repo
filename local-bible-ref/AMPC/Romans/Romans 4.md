[But] if so, what shall we say about Abraham, our forefather humanly speaking--[what did he] find out? [How does this affect his position, and what was gained by him?] 

<sup>2</sup> 

For if Abraham was justified (established as just by acquittal from guilt) by good works [that he did, then] he has grounds for boasting. But not before God! 

<sup>3</sup> 

For what does the Scripture say? Abraham believed in (trusted in) God, and it was credited to his account as righteousness (right living and right standing with God). 

<sup>4</sup> 

Now to a laborer, his wages are not counted as a favor or a gift, but as an obligation (something owed to him). 

<sup>5</sup> 

But to one who, not working [by the Law], trusts (believes fully) in Him Who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited to him as righteousness (the standing acceptable to God). 

<sup>6</sup> 

Thus David congratulates the man and pronounces a blessing on him to whom God credits righteousness apart from the works he does: 

<sup>7</sup> 

Blessed and happy and to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up and completely buried. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Blessed and happy and to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account nor reckon it against him. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Is this blessing (happiness) then meant only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. 

<sup>10</sup> 

How then was it credited [to him]? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He received the mark of circumcision as a token or an evidence [and] seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised--[faith] so that he was to be made the father of all who [truly] believe, though without circumcision, and who thus have righteousness (right standing with God) imputed to them and credited to their account, 

<sup>12</sup> 

As well as [that he be made] the father of those circumcised persons who are not merely circumcised, but also walk in the way of that faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For the promise to Abraham or his posterity, that he should inherit the world, did not come through [observing the commands of] the Law but through the righteousness of faith. 

<sup>14</sup> 

If it is the adherents of the Law who are to be the heirs, then faith is made futile and empty of all meaning and the promise [of God] is made void (is annulled and has no power). 

<sup>15</sup> 

For the Law results in [divine] wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression [of it either]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Therefore, [inheriting] the promise is the outcome of faith and depends [entirely] on faith, in order that it might be given as an act of grace (unmerited favor), to make it stable and valid and guaranteed to all his descendants--not only to the devotees and adherents of the Law, but also to those who share the faith of Abraham, who is [thus] the father of us all. 

<sup>17</sup> 

As it is written, I have made you the father of many nations. [He was appointed our father] in the sight of God in Whom he believed, Who gives life to the dead and speaks of the nonexistent things that [He has foretold and promised] as if they [already] existed. 

<sup>18</sup> 

[For Abraham, human reason for] hope being gone, hoped in faith that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been promised, So [numberless] shall your descendants be. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He did not weaken in faith when he considered the [utter] impotence of his own body, which was as good as dead because he was about a hundred years old, or [when he considered] the barrenness of Sarah's [deadened] womb. 

<sup>20</sup> 

No unbelief or distrust made him waver (doubtingly question) concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong and was empowered by faith as he gave praise and glory to God, 

<sup>21</sup> 

Fully satisfied and assured that God was able and mighty to keep His word and to do what He had promised. 

<sup>22</sup> 

That is why his faith was credited to him as righteousness (right standing with God). 

<sup>23</sup> 

But [the words], It was credited to him, were written not for his sake alone, 

<sup>24</sup> 

But [they were written] for our sakes too. [Righteousness, standing acceptable to God] will be granted and credited to us also who believe in (trust in, adhere to, and rely on) God, Who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, 

<sup>25</sup> 

Who was betrayed and put to death because of our misdeeds and was raised to secure our justification (our acquittal), [making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God].
