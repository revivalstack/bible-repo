After this David smote the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg-ammah out of the hands of the Philistines. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He defeated Moab, and measured them with a line, making them lie down on the ground; two lines he measured to be put to death, and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute. 

<sup>3</sup> 

David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the river [Euphrates]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

David took from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, except he reserved enough of them for 100 chariots.

And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew 22,000 of them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

David put garrisons in Syrian Damascus, and the Syrians became [his] servants and brought tribute. The Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David exacted an immense amount of bronze. 

<sup>9</sup> 

When Toi king of Hamath heard about David's defeat of all the forces of Hadadezer, 

<sup>10</sup> 

[He] sent Joram his son to King David to salute and congratulate him about his battle and defeat of Hadadezer. For Hadadezer had had wars with Toi. Joram brought vessels of silver, gold, and bronze. 

<sup>11</sup> 

These King David dedicated to the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations he subdued: 

<sup>12</sup> 

From Syria, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 

<sup>13</sup> 

David won renown. When he returned he slew 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He put garrisons throughout all Edom, and all the Edomites became his servants. And the Lord preserved and gave victory to [him] wherever he went. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So David reigned over all Israel, and executed justice and righteousness for all his people.

<sup>18</sup> 

Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king's bodyguards]; and David's sons were chief [confidential] assistants to the king.
