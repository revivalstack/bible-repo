Now the tax collectors and [notorious and especially wicked] sinners were all coming near to [Jesus] to listen to Him. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the Pharisees and the scribes kept muttering and indignantly complaining, saying, This man accepts and receives and welcomes [preeminently wicked] sinners and eats with them. 

<sup>3</sup> 

So He told them this parable: 

<sup>4</sup> 

What man of you, if he has a hundred sheep and should lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness (desert) and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? 

<sup>5</sup> 

And when he has found it, he lays it on his [own] shoulders, rejoicing. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And when he gets home, he summons together [his] friends and [his] neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep which was lost. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Thus, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind, abhorring his errors and misdeeds, and determines to enter upon a better course of life) than over ninety-nine righteous persons who have no need of repentance. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Or what woman, having ten [silver] drachmas [each one equal to a day's wages], if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and look carefully and diligently until she finds it? 

<sup>9</sup> 

And when she has found it, she summons her [women] friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the silver coin which I had lost. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Even so, I tell you, there is joy among and in the presence of the angels of God over one [especially] wicked person who repents (changes his mind for the better, heartily amending his ways, with abhorrence of his past sins). 

<sup>11</sup> 

And He said, There was a certain man who had two sons; 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the part of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided the estate between them. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And not many days after that, the younger son gathered up all that he had and journeyed into a distant country, and there he wasted his fortune in reckless and loose [from restraint] living. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And when he had spent all he had, a mighty famine came upon that country, and he began to fall behind and be in want. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So he went and forced (glued) himself upon one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed hogs. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he would gladly have fed on and filled his belly with the carob pods that the hogs were eating, but [they could not satisfy his hunger and] nobody gave him anything [better]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father have enough food, and [even food] to spare, but I am perishing (dying) here of hunger! 

<sup>18</sup> 

I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. 

<sup>19</sup> 

I am no longer worthy to be called your son; [just] make me like one of your hired servants. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So he got up and came to his [own] father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity and tenderness [for him]; and he ran and embraced him and kissed him [fervently]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son [I no longer deserve to be recognized as a son of yours]! 

<sup>22</sup> 

But the father said to his bond servants, Bring quickly the best robe (the festive robe of honor) and put it on him; and give him a ring for his hand and sandals for his feet. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And bring out that [wheat-]fattened calf and kill it; and let us revel and feast and be happy and make merry, 

<sup>24</sup> 

Because this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found! And they began to revel and feast and make merry. 

<sup>25</sup> 

But his older son was in the field; and as he returned and came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And having called one of the servant [boys] to him, he began to ask what this meant. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed that [wheat-]fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and well. 

<sup>28</sup> 

But [the elder brother] was angry [with deep-seated wrath] and resolved not to go in. Then his father came out and began to plead with him, 

<sup>29</sup> 

But he answered his father, Look! These many years I have served you, and I have never disobeyed your command. Yet you never gave me [so much as] a [little] kid, that I might revel and feast and be happy and make merry with my friends; 

<sup>30</sup> 

But when this son of yours arrived, who has devoured your estate with immoral women, you have killed for him that [wheat-] fattened calf! 

<sup>31</sup> 

And the father said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. 

<sup>32</sup> 

But it was fitting to make merry, to revel and feast and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!
