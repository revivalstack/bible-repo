<sup>1</sup> 

Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread was drawing near, which is called the Passover. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to do away with [Jesus], for they feared the people. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But [then] Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve [apostles]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray Him and deliver Him up to them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And they were delighted and pledged [themselves] to give him money. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So he agreed [to this], and sought an opportunity to betray Him to them [without an uprising] in the absence of the throng. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover [lamb] had to be slain. 

<sup>8</sup> 

So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the Passover meal, that we may eat it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

They said to Him, Where do You want us to prepare [it]? 

<sup>10</sup> 

He said to them, Behold, when you have gone into the city, a man carrying an earthen jug or pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house which he enters, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover [meal] with My disciples? 

<sup>12</sup> 

And he will show you a large room upstairs, furnished [with carpets and with couches properly spread]; there make [your] preparations. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And they went and found it [just] as He had said to them; and they made ready the Passover [supper]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And when the hour came, [Jesus] reclined at table, and the apostles with Him. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And He said to them, I have earnestly and intensely desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; 

<sup>16</sup> 

For I say to you, I shall eat it no more until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And He took a cup, and when He had given thanks, He said, Take this and divide and distribute it among yourselves; 

<sup>18</sup> 

For I say to you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine at all until the kingdom of God comes. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then He took a loaf [of bread], and when He had given thanks, He broke [it] and gave it to them saying, This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And in like manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament or covenant [ratified] in My blood, which is shed (poured out) for you. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But, behold, the hand of him who is now engaged in betraying Me is with Me on the table. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For the Son of Man is going as it has been determined and appointed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed and delivered up! 

<sup>23</sup> 

And they began to inquire among themselves which of them it was who was about to do this. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Now an eager contention arose among them [as to] which of them was considered and reputed to be the greatest. 

<sup>25</sup> 

But Jesus said to them, The kings of the Gentiles are deified by them and exercise lordship [ruling as emperor-gods] over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors and well-doers. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But this is not to be so with you; on the contrary, let him who is the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who is the chief and leader like one who serves. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For who is the greater, the one who reclines at table (the master), or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am in your midst as One Who serves. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And you are those who have remained [throughout] and persevered with Me in My trials; 

<sup>29</sup> 

And as My Father has appointed a kingdom and conferred it on Me, so do I confer on you [the privilege and decree], 

<sup>30</sup> 

That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Simon, Simon (Peter), listen! Satan has asked excessively that [all of] you be given up to him [out of the power and keeping of God], that he might sift [all of] you like grain, 

<sup>32</sup> 

But I have prayed especially for you [Peter], that your [own] faith may not fail; and when you yourself have turned again, strengthen and establish your brethren. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And [Simon Peter] said to Him, Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death. 

<sup>34</sup> 

But Jesus said, I tell you, Peter, before a [single] cock shall crow this day, you will three times [utterly] deny that you know Me. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And He said to them, When I sent you out with no purse or [provision] bag or sandals, did you lack anything? They answered, Nothing! 

<sup>36</sup> 

Then He said to them, But now let him who has a purse take it, and also [his provision] bag; and let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy a sword. 

<sup>37</sup> 

For I tell you that this Scripture must yet be fulfilled in Me: And He was counted and classed among the wicked (the outlaws, the criminals); for what is written about Me has its fulfillment [has reached its end and is finally settled]. 

<sup>38</sup> 

And they said, Look, Lord! Here are two swords. And He said to them, It is enough. 

<sup>39</sup> 

And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed Him. 

<sup>40</sup> 

And when He came to the place, He said to them, Pray that you may not [at all] enter into temptation. 

<sup>41</sup> 

And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw and knelt down and prayed, 

<sup>42</sup> 

Saying, Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but [always] Yours be done. 

<sup>43</sup> 

And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him in spirit. 

<sup>44</sup> 

And being in an agony [of mind], He prayed [all the] more earnestly and intently, and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground. 

<sup>45</sup> 

And when He got up from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from grief, 

<sup>46</sup> 

And He said to them, Why do you sleep? Get up and pray that you may not enter [at all] into temptation. 

<sup>47</sup> 

And while He was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve [apostles], was going before [leading] them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss Him, 

<sup>48</sup> 

But Jesus said to him, Judas! Would you betray and deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss? 

<sup>49</sup> 

And when those who were around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? 

<sup>50</sup> 

And one of them struck the bond servant of the high priest and cut off his ear, the right one. 

<sup>51</sup> 

But Jesus said, Permit them to go so far [as to seize Me]. And He touched the little (insignificant) ear and healed him. 

<sup>52</sup> 

Then Jesus said to those who had come out against Him--the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders [of the Sanhedrin]--Have you come out with swords and clubs as [you would] against a robber? 

<sup>53</sup> 

When I was with you day after day in the temple [enclosure], you did not stretch forth [your] hands against Me. But this is your hour--and the power [which] darkness [gives you has its way]. 

<sup>54</sup> 

Then they seized Him and led Him away, bringing Him into the house of the high priest. Peter was following at a distance. 

<sup>55</sup> 

And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were seated together, Peter sat among them. 

<sup>56</sup> 

Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and gazing [intently] at him, said, This man too was with Him. 

<sup>57</sup> 

But he denied it and said, Woman, I do not know Him! 

<sup>58</sup> 

And a little later someone else saw him and said, You are one of them also. But Peter said, Man, I am not! 

<sup>59</sup> 

And when about an hour more had elapsed, still another emphatically insisted, It is the truth that this man also was with Him, for he too is a Galilean! 

<sup>60</sup> 

But Peter said, Man, I do not know what you are talking about. And instantly, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed. 

<sup>61</sup> 

And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter recalled the Lord's words, how He had told him, Before the cock crows today, you will deny Me thrice. 

<sup>62</sup> 

And he went out and wept bitterly [that is, with painfully moving grief]. 

<sup>63</sup> 

Now the men who had Jesus in custody treated Him with contempt and scoffed at and ridiculed Him and beat Him; 

<sup>64</sup> 

They blindfolded Him also and asked Him, Prophesy! Who is it that struck You? 

<sup>65</sup> 

And they said many other evil and slanderous and insulting words against Him, reviling Him. 

<sup>66</sup> 

As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led Him into their council (the Sanhedrin), and they said, 

<sup>67</sup> 

If You are the Christ (the Messiah), tell us. But He said to them, If I tell you, you will not believe (trust in, cleave to, and rely on what I say), 

<sup>68</sup> 

And if I question you, you will not answer. 

<sup>69</sup> 

But hereafter (from this time on), the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of the power of God. 

<sup>70</sup> 

And they all said, You are the Son of God, then? And He said to them, It is just as you say; I Am. 

<sup>71</sup> 

And they said, What further evidence do we need? For we have heard [it] ourselves from His own mouth!
