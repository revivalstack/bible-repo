<sup>1</sup> 

Then Jesus, full of and controlled by the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led in [by] the [Holy] Spirit 

<sup>2</sup> 

For (during) forty days in the wilderness (desert), where He was tempted (tried, tested exceedingly) by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, He was hungry. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then the devil said to Him, If You are the Son of God, order this stone to turn into a loaf [of bread]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Jesus replied to him, It is written, Man shall not live and be sustained by (on) bread alone but by every word and expression of God. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time [in the twinkling of an eye]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And he said to Him, To You I will give all this power and authority and their glory (all their magnificence, excellence, preeminence, dignity, and grace), for it has been turned over to me, and I give it to whomever I will. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Therefore if You will do homage to and worship me [just once], it shall all be Yours. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And Jesus replied to him, Get behind Me, Satan! It is written, You shall do homage to and worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then he took Him to Jerusalem and set Him on a gable of the temple, and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, cast Yourself down from here; 

<sup>10</sup> 

For it is written, He will give His angels charge over you to guard and watch over you closely and carefully; 

<sup>11</sup> 

And on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And Jesus replied to him, [The Scripture] says, You shall not tempt (try, test exceedingly) the Lord your God. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And when the devil had ended every [the complete cycle of] temptation, he [temporarily] left Him [that is, stood off from Him] until another more opportune and favorable time. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then Jesus went back full of and under the power of the [Holy] Spirit into Galilee, and the fame of Him spread through the whole region round about. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And He Himself conducted [a course of] teaching in their synagogues, being recognized and honored and praised by all. 

<sup>16</sup> 

So He came to Nazareth, [that Nazareth] where He had been brought up, and He entered the synagogue, as was His custom on the Sabbath day. And He stood up to read. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And there was handed to Him [the roll of] the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened (unrolled) the book and found the place where it was written, 

<sup>18</sup> 

The Spirit of the Lord [is] upon Me, because He has anointed Me [the Anointed One, the Messiah] to preach the good news (the Gospel) to the poor; He has sent Me to announce release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth as delivered those who are oppressed [who are downtrodden, bruised, crushed, and broken down by calamity], 

<sup>19</sup> 

To proclaim the accepted and acceptable year of the Lord [the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then He rolled up the book and gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing [attentively] at Him. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And He began to speak to them: Today this Scripture has been fulfilled while you are present and hearing. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came forth from His mouth; and they said, Is not this Joseph's Son? 

<sup>23</sup> 

So He said to them, You will doubtless quote to Me this proverb: Physician, heal Yourself! What we have learned by hearsay that You did in Capernaum, do here also in Your [own] town. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then He said, Solemnly I say to you, no prophet is acceptable and welcome in his [own] town (country). 

<sup>25</sup> 

But in truth I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were closed up for three years and six months, so that there came a great famine over all the land; 

<sup>26</sup> 

And yet Elijah was not sent to a single one of them, but only to Zarephath in the country of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and yet not one of them was cleansed [by being healed]--but only Naaman the Syrian. 

<sup>28</sup> 

When they heard these things, all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And rising up, they pushed and drove Him out of the town, and [laying hold of Him] they led Him to the [projecting] upper part of the hill on which their town was built, that they might hurl Him headlong down [over the cliff]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

But passing through their midst, He went on His way. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And He descended to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and there He continued to teach the people on the Sabbath days. 

<sup>32</sup> 

And they were amazed at His teaching, for His word was with authority and ability and weight and power. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Now in the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by the foul spirit of a demon; and he cried out with a loud (deep, terrible) cry, 

<sup>34</sup> 

Ah, let us alone! What have You to do with us [What have we in common], Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know Who You are--the Holy One of God! 

<sup>35</sup> 

But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent (muzzled, gagged), and come out of him! And when the demon had thrown the man down in their midst, he came out of him without injuring him in any possible way. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And they were all amazed and said to one another, What kind of talk is this? For with authority and power He commands the foul spirits and they come out! 

<sup>37</sup> 

And a rumor about Him spread into every place in the surrounding country. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Then He arose and left the synagogue and went into Simon's (Peter's) house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering in the grip of a burning fever, and they pleaded with Him for her. 

<sup>39</sup> 

And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her; and immediately she got up and began waiting on them. 

<sup>40</sup> 

Now at the setting of the sun [indicating the end of the Sabbath], all those who had any [who were] sick with various diseases brought them to Him, and He laid His hands upon every one of them and cured them. 

<sup>41</sup> 

And demons even came out of many people, screaming and crying out, You are the Son of God! But He rebuked them and would not permit them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ (the Messiah). 

<sup>42</sup> 

And when daybreak came, He left [Peter's house] and went into an isolated [desert] place. And the people looked for Him until they came up to Him and tried to prevent Him from leaving them. 

<sup>43</sup> 

But He said to them, I must preach the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God to the other cities [and towns] also, for I was sent for this [purpose]. 

<sup>44</sup> 

And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
