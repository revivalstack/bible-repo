<sup>1</sup> 

Soon afterward, [Jesus] went on through towns and villages, preaching and bringing the good news (the Gospel) of the kingdom of God. And the Twelve [apostles] were with Him, 

<sup>2</sup> 

And also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had been expelled; 

<sup>3</sup> 

And Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager; and Susanna; and many others, who ministered to and provided for Him and them out of their property and personal belongings. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And when a very great throng was gathering together and people from town after town kept coming to Jesus, He said in a parable: 

<sup>5</sup> 

A sower went out to sow seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the traveled path and was trodden underfoot, and the birds of the air ate it up. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And some [seed] fell on the rock, and as soon as it sprouted, it withered away because it had no moisture. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And other [seed] fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it [off]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And some seed fell into good soil, and grew up and yielded a crop a hundred times [as great]. As He said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him be listening and let him consider and understand by hearing! 

<sup>9</sup> 

And when His disciples asked Him the meaning of this parable, 

<sup>10</sup> 

He said to them, To you it has been given to [come progressively to] know (to recognize and understand more strongly and clearly) the mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that, [though] looking, they may not see; and hearing, they may not comprehend. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Now the meaning of the parable is this: The seed is the Word of God. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Those along the traveled road are the people who have heard; then the devil comes and carries away the message out of their hearts, that they may not believe (acknowledge Me as their Savior and devote themselves to Me) and be saved [here and hereafter]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And those upon the rock [are the people] who, when they hear [the Word], receive and welcome it with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, and in time of trial and temptation fall away (withdraw and stand aloof). 

<sup>14</sup> 

And as for what fell among the thorns, these are [the people] who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked and suffocated with the anxieties and cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not ripen (come to maturity and perfection). 

<sup>15</sup> 

But as for that [seed] in the good soil, these are [the people] who, hearing the Word, hold it fast in a just (noble, virtuous) and worthy heart, and steadily bring forth fruit with patience. 

<sup>16</sup> 

No one after he has lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a [dining table] couch; but he puts it on a lampstand, that those who come in may see the light. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come out into the open. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Be careful therefore how you listen. For to him who has [spiritual knowledge] will more be given; and from him who does not have [spiritual knowledge], even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then Jesus' mother and His brothers came along toward Him, but they could not get to Him because of the crowd. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And it was told Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to have an interview with You. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But He answered them, My mother and My brothers are those who listen to the Word of God and do it! 

<sup>22</sup> 

One of those days He and His disciples got into a boat, and He said to them, Let us go across to the other side of the lake. So they put out to sea. 

<sup>23</sup> 

But as they were sailing, He fell off to sleep. And a  whirlwind revolving from below upwards swept down on the lake, and the boat was filling with water, and they were in great danger. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And the disciples came and woke Him, saying, Master, Master, we are perishing! And He, being thoroughly awakened, censured and blamed and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there came a calm. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And He said to them, [Why are you so fearful?] Where is your faith (your trust, your confidence in Me--in My veracity and My integrity)? And they were seized with alarm and profound and reverent dread, and they marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He commands even wind and sea, and they obey Him? 

<sup>26</sup> 

Then they came to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Now when Jesus stepped out on land, there met Him a certain man out of the town who had [was possessed by] demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And when he saw Jesus, he raised a deep (terrible) cry [from the depths of his throat] and fell down before Him [in terror] and shouted loudly, What have You [to do] with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? [What have we in common?] I beg You, do not torment me! 

<sup>29</sup> 

For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had snatched and held him; he was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into the wilderness (desert). 

<sup>30</sup> 

Jesus then asked him, What is your name? And he answered, Legion; for many demons had entered him. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And they begged [Jesus] not to command them to depart into the Abyss (bottomless pit). 

<sup>32</sup> 

Now a great herd of swine was there feeding on the hillside; and [the demons] begged Him to give them leave to enter these. And He allowed them [to do so]. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Then the demons came out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep cliff into the lake and were drowned. 

<sup>34</sup> 

When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told it in the town and in the country. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And [people] went out to see what had occurred, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right (sound) mind; and they were seized with alarm and fear. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And those [also] who had seen it told them how he who had been possessed with demons was restored [to health]. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Then all the people of the country surrounding the Gerasenes' district asked [Jesus] to depart from them, for they were possessed and suffering with dread and terror; so He entered a boat and returned [to the west side of the Sea of Galilee]. 

<sup>38</sup> 

But the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging and praying that he might accompany Him and be with Him, but [Jesus] sent him away, saying, 

<sup>39</sup> 

Return to your home, and recount [the story] of how many and great things God has done for you. And [the man] departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him. 

<sup>40</sup> 

Now when Jesus came back [to Galilee], the crowd received and welcomed Him gladly, for they were all waiting and looking for Him. 

<sup>41</sup> 

And there came a man named Jairus, who had [for a long time] been a director of the synagogue; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he begged Him to come to his house, 

<sup>42</sup> 

For he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. As [Jesus] went, the people pressed together around Him [almost suffocating Him]. 

<sup>43</sup> 

And a woman who had suffered from a flow of blood for twelve years and had spent all her living upon physicians, and could not be healed by anyone, 

<sup>44</sup> 

Came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment, and immediately her flow of blood ceased. 

<sup>45</sup> 

And Jesus said, Who is it who touched Me? When all were denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, Master, the multitudes surround You and press You on every side! 

<sup>46</sup> 

But Jesus said, Someone did touch Me; for I perceived that [healing] power has gone forth from Me. 

<sup>47</sup> 

And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came up trembling, and, falling down before Him, she declared in the presence of all the people for what reason she had touched Him and how she had been instantly cured. 

<sup>48</sup> 

And He said to her, Daughter, your faith (your confidence and trust in Me) has made you well! Go (enter) into peace (untroubled, undisturbed well-being). 

<sup>49</sup> 

While He was still speaking, a man from the house of the director of the synagogue came and said [to Jairus], Your daughter is dead; do not weary and trouble the Teacher any further. 

<sup>50</sup> 

But Jesus, on hearing this, answered him, Do not be seized with alarm or struck with fear; simply believe [in Me as able to do this], and she shall be made well. 

<sup>51</sup> 

And when He came to the house, He permitted no one to enter with Him except Peter and John and James, and the girl's father and mother. 

<sup>52</sup> 

And all were weeping for and bewailing her; but He said, Do not weep, for she is not dead but sleeping. 

<sup>53</sup> 

And they laughed Him to scorn, knowing full well that she was dead. 

<sup>54</sup> 

And grasping her hand, He called, saying, Child, arise [from the sleep of death]! 

<sup>55</sup> 

And her spirit returned [from death], and she arose immediately; and He directed that she should be given something to eat. 

<sup>56</sup> 

And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had occurred.
