<sup>1</sup> 

Set the trumpet to your lips! [The enemy] comes as a [great] vulture against the house of the Lord, because they have broken My covenant and transgressed against My law. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then they will cry to Me, My God, we [of Israel] know You! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Israel has rejected the good [with loathing]; the enemy shall pursue him. 

<sup>4</sup> 

They set up kings, but not from Me [therefore without My blessing]; they have made princes or removed them [without consulting Me; therefore], I knew and recognized [them] not. With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves, that they [the silver and the gold] may be destroyed. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your calf [idol], O Samaria, is loathsome and I have spurned it. My wrath burns against them. How long will it be before they attain purity? 

<sup>6</sup> 

For this [calf] too is from Israel; a craftsman made it; therefore it is not God. The calf of Samaria shall be broken to shivers and go up in flames. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For they sow the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; it shall yield no meal; if it were to yield, strangers and aliens would eat it up. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Israel is [as if] swallowed up. Already they have become among the nations as a vessel [of cheap, coarse pottery] that is useless. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass taking her own way by herself; Ephraim has hired lovers. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Yes, though with presents they hire [allies] among the nations, now will I gather them up, and in a little while they will sorrow and begin to diminish [their gifts] because of the burden (tribute) imposed by the king of princes [the king of Assyria]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning; yes, to him altars are intended for sinning. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law, but they are counted as a strange thing [as something which does not concern him]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

My sacrificial gifts they sacrifice [as a mere form]; yes, they sacrifice flesh and eat it, but the Lord does not accept them. Now He will [earnestly] remember their guilt and iniquity and will punish their sins. They shall return to [another] Egypt [Assyria]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces and idol temples, and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour his palaces and fortified buildings.
