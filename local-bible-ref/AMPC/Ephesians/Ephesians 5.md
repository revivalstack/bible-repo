<sup>1</sup> 

Therefore be imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And walk in love, [esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a slain offering and sacrifice to God [for you, so that it became] a sweet fragrance. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But immorality (sexual vice) and all impurity [of lustful, rich, wasteful living] or greediness must not even be named among you, as is fitting and proper among saints (God's consecrated people). 

<sup>4</sup> 

Let there be no filthiness (obscenity, indecency) nor foolish and sinful (silly and corrupt) talk, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting or becoming; but instead voice your thankfulness [to God]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For be sure of this: that no person practicing sexual vice or impurity in thought or in life, or one who is covetous [who has lustful desire for the property of others and is greedy for gain]--for he [in effect] is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Let no one delude and deceive you with empty excuses and groundless arguments [for these sins], for through these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of rebellion and disobedience. 

<sup>7</sup> 

So do not associate or be sharers with them. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of Light [lead the lives of those native-born to the Light]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For the fruit (the effect, the product) of the Light or the Spirit [consists] in every form of kindly goodness, uprightness of heart, and trueness of life. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And try to learn [in your experience] what is pleasing to the Lord [let your lives be constant proofs of what is most acceptable to Him]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Take no part in and have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds and enterprises of darkness, but instead [let your lives be so in contrast as to] expose and reprove and convict them. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For it is a shame even to speak of or mention the things that [such people] practice in secret. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But when anything is exposed and reproved by the light, it is made visible and clear; and where everything is visible and clear there is light. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Therefore He says, Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine (make day dawn) upon you and give you light. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Look carefully then how you walk! Live purposefully and worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless, but as wise (sensible, intelligent people), 

<sup>16</sup> 

Making the very most of the time [buying up each opportunity], because the days are evil. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Therefore do not be vague and thoughtless and foolish, but understanding and firmly grasping what the will of the Lord is. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but ever be filled and stimulated with the [Holy] Spirit. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Speak out to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, offering praise with voices [and instruments] and making melody with all your heart to the Lord, 

<sup>20</sup> 

At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 

<sup>22</sup> 

Wives, be subject (be submissive and adapt yourselves) to your own husbands as [a service] to the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For the husband is head of the wife as Christ is the Head of the church, Himself the Savior of [His] body. 

<sup>24</sup> 

As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 

<sup>26</sup> 

So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word, 

<sup>27</sup> 

That He might present the church to Himself in glorious splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such things [that she might be holy and faultless]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Even so husbands should love their wives as [being in a sense] their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. 

<sup>29</sup> 

For no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and carefully protects and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, 

<sup>30</sup> 

Because we are members (parts) of His body. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. 

<sup>32</sup> 

This mystery is very great, but I speak concerning [the relation of] Christ and the church. 

<sup>33</sup> 

However, let each man of you [without exception] love his wife as [being in a sense] his very own self; and let the wife see that she respects and reverences her husband [that she notices him, regards him, honors him, prefers him, venerates, and esteems him; and that she defers to him, praises him, and loves and admires him exceedingly].
