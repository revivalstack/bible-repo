<sup>1</sup> 

Children, obey your parents in the Lord [as His representatives], for this is just and right. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Honor (esteem and value as precious) your father and your mother--this is the first commandment with a promise-- 

<sup>3</sup> 

That all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Fathers, do not irritate and provoke your children to anger [do not exasperate them to resentment], but rear them [tenderly] in the training and discipline and the counsel and admonition of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Servants (slaves), be obedient to those who are your physical masters, having respect for them and eager concern to please them, in singleness of motive and with all your heart, as [service] to Christ [Himself]-- 

<sup>6</sup> 

Not in the way of eye-service [as if they were watching you] and only to please men, but as servants (slaves) of Christ, doing the will of God heartily and with your whole soul; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Rendering service readily with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Knowing that for whatever good anyone does, he will receive his reward from the Lord, whether he is slave or free. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You masters, act on the same [principle] toward them and give up threatening and using violent and abusive words, knowing that He Who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no respect of persons (no partiality) with Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

In conclusion, be strong in the Lord [be empowered through your union with Him]; draw your strength from Him [that strength which His boundless might provides]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Put on God's whole armor [the armor of a heavy-armed soldier which God supplies], that you may be able successfully to stand up against [all] the strategies and the deceits of the devil. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For we are not wrestling with flesh and blood [contending only with physical opponents], but against the despotisms, against the powers, against [the master spirits who are] the world rulers of this present darkness, against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly (supernatural) sphere. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Therefore put on God's complete armor, that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day [of danger], and, having done all [the crisis demands], to stand [firmly in your place]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Stand therefore [hold your ground], having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And having shod your feet in preparation [to face the enemy with the firm-footed stability, the promptness, and the readiness produced by the good news] of the Gospel of peace. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Lift up over all the [covering] shield of saving faith, upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked [one]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And take the helmet of salvation and the sword that the Spirit wields, which is the Word of God. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Pray at all times (on every occasion, in every season) in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty. To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance, interceding in behalf of all the saints (God's consecrated people). 

<sup>19</sup> 

And [pray] also for me, that [freedom of] utterance may be given me, that I may open my mouth to proclaim boldly the mystery of the good news (the Gospel), 

<sup>20</sup> 

For which I am an ambassador in a coupling chain [in prison. Pray] that I may declare it boldly and courageously, as I ought to do. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Now that you may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord [and His service], will tell you everything. 

<sup>22</sup> 

I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may console and cheer and encourage and strengthen your hearts. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Peace be to the brethren, and love joined with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). 

<sup>24</sup> 

Grace (God's undeserved favor) be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with undying and incorruptible [love]. Amen (so let it be).
