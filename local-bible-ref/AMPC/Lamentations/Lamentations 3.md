<sup>1</sup> 

I am [Jeremiah] the man who has seen affliction under the rod of His wrath. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He has led me and brought me into darkness and not light. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Surely He has turned away from me; His hand is against me all the day. 

<sup>4</sup> 

My flesh and my skin has He worn out and made old; He has shattered my bones. 

<sup>5</sup> 

He has built up [siege mounds] against me and surrounded me with bitterness, tribulation, and anguish. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He has caused me to dwell in dark places like those long dead. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He walled me in so that I cannot get out; He has weighted down my chain. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Even when I cry and shout for help, He shuts out my prayer. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He is to me like a bear lying in wait, and like a lion [hiding] in secret places. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He has turned me off my ways and pulled me in pieces; He has made me desolate. 

<sup>12</sup> 

He has bent His bow and set me as a mark for the arrow. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He has caused the arrows of His quiver to enter into my heart [the seat of my affections and desires]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I have become a derision to all my people, and [the subject of] their singsong all the day. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He has filled me with bitterness; He has made me drink to excess and until drunken with wormwood [bitterness]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He has also broken my teeth with gravel (stones); He has covered me with ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And You have bereaved my soul and cast it off far from peace; I have forgotten what good and happiness are. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And I say, Perished is my strength and my expectation from the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[O Lord] remember [earnestly] my affliction and my misery, my wandering and my outcast state, the wormwood and the gall. 

<sup>20</sup> 

My soul has them continually in remembrance and is bowed down within me. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But this I recall and therefore have I hope and expectation: 

<sup>22</sup> 

It is because of the Lord's mercy and loving-kindness that we are not consumed, because His [tender] compassions fail not. 

<sup>23</sup> 

They are new every morning; great and abundant is Your stability and faithfulness. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The Lord is my portion or share, says my living being (my inner self); therefore will I hope in Him and wait expectantly for Him. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The Lord is good to those who wait hopefully and expectantly for Him, to those who seek Him [inquire of and for Him and require Him by right of necessity and on the authority of God's word]. 

<sup>26</sup> 

It is good that one should hope in and wait quietly for the salvation (the safety and ease) of the Lord. 

<sup>27</sup> 

It is good for a man that he should bear the yoke [of divine disciplinary dealings] in his youth. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Let him sit alone uncomplaining and keeping silent [in hope], because [God] has laid [the yoke] upon him [for his benefit]. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Let him put his mouth in the dust [in abject recognition of his unworthiness]--there may yet be hope. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Let him give his cheek to the One Who smites him [even through His human agents]; let him be filled [full] with [men's] reproach [in meekness]. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For the Lord will not cast off forever! 

<sup>32</sup> 

But though He causes grief, yet will He be moved to compassion according to the multitude of His loving-kindness and tender mercy. 

<sup>33</sup> 

For He does not willingly and from His heart afflict or grieve the children of men. 

<sup>34</sup> 

To trample and crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth, 

<sup>35</sup> 

To turn aside and deprive a man of his rights before the face of the Most High or a superior [acting as God's representative], 

<sup>36</sup> 

To subvert a man in his cause--[of these things] the Lord does not approve. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Who is he who speaks and it comes to pass, if the Lord has not authorized and commanded it? 

<sup>38</sup> 

Is it not out of the mouth of the Most High that evil and good both proceed [adversity and prosperity, physical evil or misfortune and physical good or happiness]? 

<sup>39</sup> 

Why does a living man sigh [one who is still in this life's school of discipline]? [And why does] a man complain for the punishment of his sins? 

<sup>40</sup> 

Let us test and examine our ways, and let us return to the Lord! 

<sup>41</sup> 

Let us lift up our hearts and our hands [and then with them mount up in prayer] to God in heaven: 

<sup>42</sup> 

We have transgressed and rebelled and You have not pardoned. 

<sup>43</sup> 

You have covered Yourself with wrath and pursued and afflicted us; You have slain without pity. 

<sup>44</sup> 

You have covered Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through. 

<sup>45</sup> 

You have made us offscouring and refuse among the nations. 

<sup>46</sup> 

All our enemies have gaped at us and railed against us. 

<sup>47</sup> 

Fear and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction. 

<sup>48</sup> 

My eyes overflow with streams of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

<sup>49</sup> 

My eyes overflow continually and will not cease 

<sup>50</sup> 

Until the Lord looks down and sees from heaven. 

<sup>51</sup> 

My eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the maidens [and the daughter-towns] of my city [Jerusalem]. 

<sup>52</sup> 

I have been hunted down like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause. 

<sup>53</sup> 

They [thought they had] destroyed my life in the dungeon (pit) and cast a stone [over it] above me. 

<sup>54</sup> 

The waters ran down on my head; I said, I am gone. 

<sup>55</sup> 

I called upon Your name, O Lord, out of the depths [of the mire] of the dungeon. 

<sup>56</sup> 

You heard my voice [then]: [Oh] hide not Your ear [now] at my prayer for relief. 

<sup>57</sup> 

You drew near on the day I called to You; You said, Fear not. 

<sup>58</sup> 

O Lord, You have pleaded the causes of my soul [You have managed my affairs and You have protected my person and my rights]; You have rescued and redeemed my life! 

<sup>59</sup> 

O Lord, You have seen my wrong [done to me]; judge and maintain my cause. 

<sup>60</sup> 

You have seen all their vengeance, all their devices against me. 

<sup>61</sup> 

You have heard their reproach and revilings, O Lord, and all their devices against me-- 

<sup>62</sup> 

The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all day long. 

<sup>63</sup> 

Look at their sitting down and their rising up [their movements, doings, and secret counsels]; I am their singsong [the subject of their derision and merriment]. 

<sup>64</sup> 

Render to them a recompense, O Lord, according to the work of their hands. 

<sup>65</sup> 

You will give them hardness and blindness of heart; Your curse will be upon them. 

<sup>66</sup> 

You will pursue and afflict them in anger and destroy them from under Your heavens, O Lord.
