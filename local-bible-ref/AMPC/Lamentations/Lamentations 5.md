<sup>1</sup> 

O Lord, [earnestly] remember what has come upon us! Look down and see our reproach (our national disgrace)! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Our inheritance has fallen over to strangers, our houses to foreigners. 

<sup>3</sup> 

We have become orphans and fatherless; our mothers are like widows. 

<sup>4</sup> 

We have had to pay money to drink the water that belongs to us; our [own] wood is sold to us. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Our pursuers are upon our necks [like a yoke]; we are weary and are allowed no rest. 

<sup>6</sup> 

We have given the hand [as a pledge of fidelity and submission] to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians [merely] to get food to satisfy [our hunger]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Our fathers sinned and are no more, and we have borne their iniquities. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Servants and slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us out of their hands. 

<sup>9</sup> 

We get our bread at the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness [the wild Arabs, who may attack if we venture into the fields to reap our harvests]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Our skin glows and is parched as from [the heat of] an oven because of the burning heat of [the fever of] famine. 

<sup>11</sup> 

They ravished the women in Zion, the virgins in the cities of Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They hung princes by their hands; the persons of elders were not respected. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Young men carried millstones, and boys fell [staggering] under [burdens of] wood. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The elders have ceased from [congregating at] the city's gate, the young men from their music. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Ceased is the joy of our hearts; our dancing has turned into mourning. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The crown has fallen from our head [our honor is brought to the dust]! Woe to us, for we have sinned! 

<sup>17</sup> 

Because of this our hearts are faint and sick; because of these things our eyes are dim and see darkly. 

<sup>18</sup> 

As for Mount Zion, which lies desolate, the jackals prowl over it! 

<sup>19</sup> 

But You, O Lord, remain and reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to [all] generations. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Why do You forget us forever? Why do You forsake us so long? 

<sup>21</sup> 

Turn us to Yourself, O Lord, and we shall be turned and restored! Renew our days as of old!-- 

<sup>22</sup> 

Or have You utterly rejected us? Or are You exceedingly angry with us [still]?
