<sup>1</sup> 

In You, O Lord, do I put my trust and confidently take refuge; let me never be put to shame or confusion! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Deliver me in Your righteousness and cause me to escape; bow down Your ear to me and save me! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Be to me a rock of refuge in which to dwell, and a sheltering stronghold to which I may continually resort, which You have appointed to save me, for You are my Rock and my Fortress. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Rescue me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For You are my hope; O Lord God, You are my trust from my youth and the source of my confidence. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Upon You have I leaned and relied from birth; You are He Who took me from my mother's womb and You have been my benefactor from that day. My praise is continually of You. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I am as a wonder and surprise to many, but You are my strong refuge. 

<sup>8</sup> 

My mouth shall be filled with Your praise and with Your honor all the day. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Cast me not off nor send me away in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent and my powers fail. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For my enemies talk against me; those who watch for my life consult together, 

<sup>11</sup> 

Saying, God has forsaken him; pursue and persecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

O God, be not far from me! O my God, make haste to help me! 

<sup>13</sup> 

Let them be put to shame and consumed who are adversaries to my life; let them be covered with reproach, scorn, and dishonor who seek and require my hurt. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But I will hope continually, and will praise You yet more and more. 

<sup>15</sup> 

My mouth shall tell of Your righteous acts and of Your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is more than I know. 

<sup>16</sup> 

I will come in the strength and with the mighty acts of the Lord God; I will mention and praise Your righteousness, even Yours alone. 

<sup>17</sup> 

O God, You have taught me from my youth, and hitherto have I declared Your wondrous works. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Yes, even when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not, [but keep me alive] until I have declared Your mighty strength to [this] generation, and Your might and power to all that are to come. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Your righteousness also, O God, is very high [reaching to the heavens], You Who have done great things; O God, who is like You, or who is Your equal? 

<sup>20</sup> 

You Who have shown us [all] troubles great and sore will quicken us again and will bring us up again from the depths of the earth. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Increase my greatness (my honor) and turn and comfort me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

I will also praise You with the harp, even Your truth and faithfulness, O my God; unto You will I sing praises with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>23</sup> 

My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises to You, and my inner being, which You have redeemed. 

<sup>24</sup> 

My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the day long; for they are put to shame, for they are confounded, who seek and demand my hurt.
