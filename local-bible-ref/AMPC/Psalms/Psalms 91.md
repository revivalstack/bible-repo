<sup>1</sup> 

He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall remain stable and fixed under the shadow of the Almighty [Whose power no foe can withstand]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will say of the Lord, He is my Refuge and my Fortress, my God; on Him I lean and rely, and in Him I [confidently] trust! 

<sup>3</sup> 

For [then] He will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[Then] He will cover you with His pinions, and under His wings shall you trust and find refuge; His truth and His faithfulness are a shield and a buckler. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night, nor of the arrow (the evil plots and slanders of the wicked) that flies by day, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> 

A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not come near you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Only a spectator shall you be [yourself inaccessible in the secret place of the Most High] as you witness the reward of the wicked. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Because you have made the Lord your refuge, and the Most High your dwelling place, 

<sup>10</sup> 

There shall no evil befall you, nor any plague or calamity come near your tent. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For He will give His angels [especial] charge over you to accompany and defend and preserve you in all your ways [of obedience and service]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They shall bear you up on their hands, lest you dash your foot against a stone. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You shall tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the serpent shall you trample underfoot. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he knows and understands My name [has a personal knowledge of My mercy, love, and kindness--trusts and relies on Me, knowing I will never forsake him, no, never]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. 

<sup>16</sup> 

With long life will I satisfy him and show him My salvation.
