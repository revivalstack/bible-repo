<sup>1</sup> 

The king [David] shall joy in Your strength, O Lord; and in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 

<sup>2</sup> 

You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah [pause, and think of that]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

For You send blessings of good things to meet him; You set a crown of pure gold on his head. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He asked life of You, and You gave it to him--long life forever and evermore. 

<sup>5</sup> 

His glory is great because of Your aid; splendor and majesty You bestow upon him. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For You make him to be blessed and a blessing forever; You make him exceedingly glad with the joy of Your presence. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For the king trusts, relies on, and is confident in the Lord, and through the mercy and steadfast love of the Most High he will never be moved. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Your hand shall find all Your enemies; Your right hand shall find all those who hate You. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You will make them as if in a blazing oven in the time of Your anger; the Lord will swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire will utterly consume them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Their offspring You will destroy from the earth, and their sons from among the children of men. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For they planned evil against You; they conceived a mischievous plot which they are not able to perform. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For You will make them turn their backs; You will aim Your bow [of divine justice] at their faces. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Be exalted, Lord, in Your strength; we will sing and praise Your power.
