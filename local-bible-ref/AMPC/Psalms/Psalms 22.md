<sup>1</sup> 

My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Why are You so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning? 

<sup>2</sup> 

O my God, I cry in the daytime, but You answer not; and by night I am not silent or find no rest. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But You are holy, O You Who dwell in [the holy place where] the praises of Israel [are offered]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Our fathers trusted in You; they trusted (leaned on, relied on You, and were confident) and You delivered them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They cried to You and were delivered; they trusted in, leaned on, and confidently relied on You, and were not ashamed or confounded or disappointed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But I am a worm, and no man; I am the scorn of men, and despised by the people. 

<sup>7</sup> 

All who see me laugh at me and mock me; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 

<sup>8</sup> 

He trusted and rolled himself on the Lord, that He would deliver him. Let Him deliver him, seeing that He delights in him! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Yet You are He Who took me out of the womb; You made me hope and trust when I was on my mother's breasts. 

<sup>10</sup> 

I was cast upon You from my very birth; from my mother's womb You have been my God. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is none to help. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Many [foes like] bulls have surrounded me; strong bulls of Bashan have hedged me in. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Against me they opened their mouths wide, like a ravening and roaring lion. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; it is softened [with anguish] and melted down within me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

My strength is dried up like a fragment of clay pottery; [with thirst] my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and You have brought me into the dust of death. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For [like a pack of] dogs they have encompassed me; a company of evildoers has encircled me, they pierced my hands and my feet. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I can count all my bones; [the evildoers] gaze at me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

They part my clothing among them and cast lots for my raiment (a long, shirtlike garment, a seamless undertunic). ) 

<sup>19</sup> 

But be not far from me, O Lord; O my Help, hasten to aid me! 

<sup>20</sup> 

Deliver my life from the sword, my dear life [my only one] from the power of the dog [the agent of execution]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Save me from the lion's mouth; for You have answered me [kindly] from the horns of the wild oxen. 

<sup>22</sup> 

I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise You. 

<sup>23</sup> 

You who fear (revere and worship) the Lord, praise Him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify Him. Fear (revere and worship) Him, all you offspring of Israel. 

<sup>24</sup> 

For He has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has He hidden His face from him, but when he cried to Him, He heard. 

<sup>25</sup> 

My praise shall be of You in the great congregation. I will pay to Him my vows [made in the time of trouble] before them who fear (revere and worship) Him. 

<sup>26</sup> 

The poor and afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise the Lord--they who [diligently] seek for, inquire of and for Him, and require Him [as their greatest need]. May your hearts be quickened now and forever! 

<sup>27</sup> 

All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall bow down and worship before You, 

<sup>28</sup> 

For the kingship and the kingdom are the Lord's, and He is the ruler over the nations. 

<sup>29</sup> 

All the mighty ones upon earth shall eat [in thanksgiving] and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall bow before Him, even he who cannot keep himself alive. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Posterity shall serve Him; they shall tell of the Lord to the next generation. 

<sup>31</sup> 

They shall come and shall declare His righteousness to a people yet to be born--that He has done it [that it is finished]!
