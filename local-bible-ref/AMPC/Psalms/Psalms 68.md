<sup>1</sup> 

God is [already] beginning to arise, and His enemies to scatter; let them also who hate Him flee before Him! 

<sup>2</sup> 

As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish before the presence of God. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But let the [uncompromisingly] righteous be glad; let them be in high spirits and glory before God, yes, let them [jubilantly] rejoice! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Sing to God, sing praises to His name, cast up a highway for Him Who rides through the deserts--His name is the Lord--be in high spirits and glory before Him! 

<sup>5</sup> 

A father of the fatherless and a judge and protector of the widows is God in His holy habitation. 

<sup>6</sup> 

God places the solitary in families and gives the desolate a home in which to dwell; He leads the prisoners out to prosperity; but the rebellious dwell in a parched land. 

<sup>7</sup> 

O God, when You went forth before Your people, when You marched through the wilderness--Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!-- 

<sup>8</sup> 

The earth trembled, the heavens also poured down [rain] at the presence of God; yonder Sinai quaked at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You, O God, did send a plentiful rain; You did restore and confirm Your heritage when it languished and was weary. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Your flock found a dwelling place in it; You, O God, in Your goodness did provide for the poor and needy. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Lord gives the word [of power]; the women who bear and publish [the news] are a great host. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The kings of the enemies' armies, they flee, they flee! She who tarries at home divides the spoil [left behind]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Though you [the slackers] may lie among the sheepfolds [in slothful ease, yet for Israel] the wings of a dove are covered with silver, its pinions excessively green with gold [are trophies taken from the enemy]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

When the Almighty scattered kings in [the land], it was as when it snows on Zalmon [a wooded hill near Shechem]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Is Mount Bashan the high mountain of summits, Mount Bashan [east of the Jordan] the mount of God? 

<sup>16</sup> 

Why do you look with grudging and envy, you many-peaked mountains, at the mountain [of the city called Zion] which God has desired for His dwelling place? Yes, the Lord will dwell in it forever. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands. The Lord is among them as He was in Sinai, [so also] in the Holy Place (the sanctuary in Jerusalem). 

<sup>18</sup> 

You have ascended on high. You have led away captive a train of vanquished foes; You have received gifts of men, yes, of the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell there with them. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord, Who bears our burdens and carries us day by day, even the God Who is our salvation! Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>20</sup> 

God is to us a God of deliverances and salvation; and to God the Lord belongs escape from death [setting us free]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But God will shatter the heads of His enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in his trespasses and guilty ways. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The Lord said, I will bring back [your enemies] from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the [Red] Sea, 

<sup>23</sup> 

That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their share from the foe. 

<sup>24</sup> 

They see Your goings, O God, even the [solemn processions] of my God, my King, into the sanctuary [in holiness]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The singers go in front, the players on instruments last; between them the maidens are playing on tambourines. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Bless, give thanks, and gratefully praise God in full congregations, even the Lord, O you who are from [Jacob] the fountain of Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> 

There is little Benjamin in the lead [in the procession], the princes of Judah and their company, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Your God has commanded your strength [your might in His service and impenetrable hardness to temptation]; O God, display Your might and strengthen what You have wrought for us! 

<sup>29</sup> 

[Out of respect] for Your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bring gifts to You. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Rebuke the wild beasts dwelling among the reeds [in Egypt], the herd of bulls (the leaders) with the calves of the peoples; trample underfoot those who lust for tribute money; scatter the peoples who delight in war. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands [with the offerings of submission] to God. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praises to the Lord! Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>33</sup> 

[Sing praises] to Him Who rides upon the heavens, the ancient heavens; behold, He sends forth His voice, His mighty voice. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Ascribe power and strength to God; His majesty is over Israel, and His strength and might are in the skies. 

<sup>35</sup> 

O God, awe-inspiring, profoundly impressive, and terrible are You out of Your holy places; the God of Israel Himself gives strength and fullness of might to His people. Blessed be God!
