<sup>1</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is everyone who fears, reveres, and worships the Lord, who walks in His ways and lives according to His commandments. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For you shall eat [the fruit] of the labor of your hands; happy (blessed, fortunate, enviable) shall you be, and it shall be well with you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house; your children shall be like olive plants round about your table. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who reverently and worshipfully fears the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

May the Lord bless you out of Zion [His sanctuary], and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
