<sup>1</sup> 

Hear this, all you peoples; give ear, all you inhabitants of the world, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Both low and high, rich and poor together: 

<sup>3</sup> 

My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. 

<sup>4</sup> 

I will submit and consent to a parable or proverb; to the music of a lyre I will unfold my riddle (my problem). 

<sup>5</sup> 

Why should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of those who would supplant me surrounds me on every side, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Even of those who trust in and lean on their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? 

<sup>7</sup> 

None of them can by any means redeem [either himself or] his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him-- 

<sup>8</sup> 

For the ransom of a life is too costly, and [the price one can pay] can never suffice-- 

<sup>9</sup> 

So that he should live on forever and never see the pit (the grave) and corruption. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For he sees that even wise men die; the [self-confident] fool and the stupid alike perish and leave their wealth to others. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Their inward thought is that their houses will continue forever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands their own [apart from God] and after their own names. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But man, with all his honor and pomp, does not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. 

<sup>13</sup> 

This is the fate of those who are foolishly confident, yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>14</sup> 

Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol (the place of the dead); death shall be their shepherd. And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form and beauty shall be consumed, for Sheol shall be their dwelling. 

<sup>15</sup> 

But God will redeem me from the power of Sheol (the place of the dead); for He will receive me. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>16</sup> 

Be not afraid when [an ungodly] one is made rich, when the wealth and glory of his house are increased; 

<sup>17</sup> 

For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not descend after him. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Though while he lives he counts himself happy and prosperous, and though a man gets praise when he does well [for himself], 

<sup>19</sup> 

He will go to the generation of his fathers, who will nevermore see the light. 

<sup>20</sup> 

A man who is held in honor and understands not is like the beasts that perish.
