<sup>1</sup> 

O Lord, rebuke me not in Your anger nor discipline and chasten me in Your hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Have mercy on me and be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am weak (faint and withered away); O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 

<sup>3</sup> 

My [inner] self [as well as my body] is also exceedingly disturbed and troubled. But You, O Lord, how long [until You return and speak peace to me]? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Return [to my relief], O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of Your steadfast love and mercy. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For in death there is no remembrance of You; in Sheol (the place of the dead) who will give You thanks? 

<sup>6</sup> 

I am weary with my groaning; all night I soak my pillow with tears, I drench my couch with my weeping. 

<sup>7</sup> 

My eye grows dim because of grief; it grows old because of all my enemies. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The Lord has heard my supplication; the Lord receives my prayer. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Let all my enemies be ashamed and sorely troubled; let them turn back and be put to shame suddenly.
