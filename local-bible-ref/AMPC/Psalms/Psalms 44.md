We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us [what] work You did in their days, in the days of old. 

<sup>2</sup> 

You drove out the nations with Your hand and it was Your power that gave [Israel] a home by rooting out the [heathen] peoples, but [Israel] You spread out. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For they got not the land [of Canaan] in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your countenance [did it], because You were favorable toward and did delight in them. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You are my King, O God; command victories and deliverance for Jacob (Israel). 

<sup>5</sup> 

Through You shall we push down our enemies; through Your name shall we tread them under who rise up against us. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For I will not trust in and lean on my bow, neither shall my sword save me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But You have saved us from our foes and have put them to shame who hate us. 

<sup>8</sup> 

In God we have made our boast all the day long, and we will give thanks to Your name forever. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>9</sup> 

But now You have cast us off and brought us to dishonor, and You go not out with our armies. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You make us to turn back from the enemy, and they who hate us take spoil for themselves. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You have made us like sheep intended for mutton and have scattered us in exile among the nations. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You sell Your people for nothing, and have not increased Your wealth by their price. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the heads among the people. 

<sup>15</sup> 

My dishonor is before me all day long, and shame has covered my face 

<sup>16</sup> 

At the words of the taunter and reviler, by reason of the enemy and the revengeful. 

<sup>17</sup> 

All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten You, neither have we been false to Your covenant [which You made with our fathers]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Our hearts are not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Your path, 

<sup>19</sup> 

Though You have distressingly broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with deep darkness, even with the shadow of death. 

<sup>20</sup> 

If we had forgotten the name of our God or stretched out our hands to a strange god, 

<sup>21</sup> 

Would not God discover this? For He knows the secrets of the heart. 

<sup>22</sup> 

No, but for Your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord? Arouse Yourself, cast us not off forever! 

<sup>24</sup> 

Why do You hide Your face and forget our affliction and our oppression? 

<sup>25</sup> 

For our lives are bowed down to the dust; our bodies cleave to the ground. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Rise up! Come to our help, and deliver us for Your mercy's sake and because of Your steadfast love!
