Lord, how they are increased who trouble me! Many are they who rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Many are saying of me, There is no help for him in God. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

But You, O Lord, are a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 

<sup>4</sup> 

With my voice I cry to the Lord, and He hears and answers me out of His holy hill. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

I lay down and slept; I wakened again, for the Lord sustains me. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me round about. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Salvation belongs to the Lord; May Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!
