<sup>1</sup> 

Be merciful and gracious to me, O God, for man would trample me or devour me; all the day long the adversary oppresses me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up or trample me all day long, for they are many who fight against me, O Most High! 

<sup>3</sup> 

What time I am afraid, I will have confidence in and put my trust and reliance in You. 

<sup>4</sup> 

By [the help of] God I will praise His word; on God I lean, rely, and confidently put my trust; I will not fear. What can man, who is flesh, do to me? 

<sup>5</sup> 

All day long they twist my words and trouble my affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil and my hurt. 

<sup>6</sup> 

They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they watch my steps, even as they have [expectantly] waited for my life. 

<sup>7</sup> 

They think to escape with iniquity, and shall they? In Your indignation bring down the peoples, O God. 

<sup>8</sup> 

You number and record my wanderings; put my tears into Your bottle--are they not in Your book? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then shall my enemies turn back in the day that I cry out; this I know, for God is for me. 

<sup>10</sup> 

In God, Whose word I praise, in the Lord, Whose word I praise, 

<sup>11</sup> 

In God have I put my trust and confident reliance; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render praise to You and give You thank offerings. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For You have delivered my life from death, yes, and my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life and of the living.
