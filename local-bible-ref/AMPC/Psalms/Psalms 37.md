<sup>1</sup> 

Fret not yourself because of evildoers, neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness (that which is not upright or in right standing with God). 

<sup>2</sup> 

For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Trust (lean on, rely on, and be confident) in the Lord and do good; so shall you dwell in the land and feed surely on His faithfulness, and truly you shall be fed. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He will give you the desires and secret petitions of your heart. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Commit your way to the Lord [roll and repose each care of your load on Him]; trust (lean on, rely on, and be confident) also in Him and He will bring it to pass. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And He will make your uprightness and right standing with God go forth as the light, and your justice and right as [the shining sun of] the noonday. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Be still and rest in the Lord; wait for Him and patiently lean yourself upon Him; fret not yourself because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Cease from anger and forsake wrath; fret not yourself--it tends only to evildoing. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait and hope and look for the Lord [in the end] shall inherit the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For yet a little while, and the evildoers will be no more; though you look with care where they used to be, they will not be found. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But the meek [in the end] shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The wicked plot against the [uncompromisingly] righteous (the upright in right standing with God); they gnash at them with their teeth. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The Lord laughs at [the wicked], for He sees that their own day [of defeat] is coming. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to cast down the poor and needy, to slay those who walk uprightly (blameless in conduct and in conversation). 

<sup>15</sup> 

The swords [of the wicked] shall enter their own hearts, and their bows shall be broken. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Better is the little that the [uncompromisingly] righteous have than the abundance [of possessions] of many who are wrong and wicked. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord upholds the [consistently] righteous. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The Lord knows the days of the upright and blameless, and their heritage will abide forever. 

<sup>19</sup> 

They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs [that is consumed in smoke] and as the glory of the pastures. They shall vanish; like smoke shall they consume away. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The wicked borrow and pay not again [for they may be unable], but the [uncompromisingly] righteous deal kindly and give [for they are able]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For such as are blessed of God shall [in the end] inherit the earth, but they that are cursed of Him shall be cut off. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The steps of a [good] man are directed and established by the Lord when He delights in his way [and He busies Himself with his every step]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Though he falls, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord grasps his hand in support and upholds him. 

<sup>25</sup> 

I have been young and now am old, yet have I not seen the [uncompromisingly] righteous forsaken or their seed begging bread. 

<sup>26</sup> 

All day long they are merciful and deal graciously; they lend, and their offspring are blessed. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Depart from evil and do good; and you will dwell forever [securely]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

For the Lord delights in justice and forsakes not His saints; they are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked [in time] shall be cut off. 

<sup>29</sup> 

[Then] the [consistently] righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever. 

<sup>30</sup> 

The mouth of the [uncompromisingly] righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks with justice. 

<sup>31</sup> 

The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. 

<sup>32</sup> 

The wicked lie in wait for the [uncompromisingly] righteous and seek to put them to death. 

<sup>33</sup> 

The Lord will not leave them in their hands, or [suffer them to] condemn them when they are judged. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Wait for and expect the Lord and keep and heed His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; [in the end] when the wicked are cut off, you shall see it. 

<sup>35</sup> 

I have seen a wicked man in great power and spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil, 

<sup>36</sup> 

Yet he passed away, and behold, he was not; yes, I sought and inquired for him, but he could not be found. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Mark the blameless man and behold the upright, for there is a happy end for the man of peace. 

<sup>38</sup> 

As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together; in the end the wicked shall be cut off. 

<sup>39</sup> 

But the salvation of the [consistently] righteous is of the Lord; He is their Refuge and secure Stronghold in the time of trouble. 

<sup>40</sup> 

And the Lord helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they trust and take refuge in Him.
