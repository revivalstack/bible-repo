<sup>1</sup> 

The Lord is my Light and my Salvation--whom shall I fear or dread? The Lord is the Refuge and Stronghold of my life--of whom shall I be afraid? 

<sup>2</sup> 

When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Though a host encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, [even then] in this will I be confident. 

<sup>4</sup> 

One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek, inquire for, and [insistently] require: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord [in His presence] all the days of my life, to behold and gaze upon the beauty [the sweet attractiveness and the delightful loveliness] of the Lord and to meditate, consider, and inquire in His temple. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter; in the secret place of His tent will He hide me; He will set me high upon a rock. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me; in His tent I will offer sacrifices and shouting of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Hear, O Lord, when I cry aloud; have mercy and be gracious to me and answer me! 

<sup>8</sup> 

You have said, Seek My face [inquire for and require My presence as your vital need]. My heart says to You, Your face (Your presence), Lord, will I seek, inquire for, and require [of necessity and on the authority of Your Word]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Hide not Your face from me; turn not Your servant away in anger, You Who have been my help! Cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation! 

<sup>10</sup> 

Although my father and my mother have forsaken me, yet the Lord will take me up [adopt me as His child]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Teach me Your way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain and even path because of my enemies [those who lie in wait for me]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Give me not up to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen up against me; they breathe out cruelty and violence. 

<sup>13</sup> 

[What, what would have become of me] had I not believed that I would see the Lord's goodness in the land of the living! 

<sup>14</sup> 

Wait and hope for and expect the Lord; be brave and of good courage and let your heart be stout and enduring. Yes, wait for and hope for and expect the Lord.
