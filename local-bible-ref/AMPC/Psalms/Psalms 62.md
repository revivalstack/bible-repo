<sup>1</sup> 

For God alone my soul waits in silence; from Him comes my salvation. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He only is my Rock and my Salvation, my Defense and my Fortress, I shall not be greatly moved.

How long will you set upon a man that you may slay him, all of you, like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?

They only consult to cast him down from his height [to dishonor him]; they delight in lies. They bless with their mouths, but they curse inwardly. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

My soul, wait only upon God and silently submit to Him; for my hope and expectation are from Him. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He only is my Rock and my Salvation; He is my Defense and my Fortress, I shall not be moved. 

<sup>7</sup> 

With God rests my salvation and my glory; He is my Rock of unyielding strength and impenetrable hardness, and my refuge is in God! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Trust in, lean on, rely on, and have confidence in Him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is a refuge for us (a fortress and a high tower). Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!

Men of low degree [in the social scale] are emptiness (futility, a breath) and men of high degree [in the same scale] are a lie and a delusion. In the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Trust not in and rely confidently not on extortion and oppression, and do not vainly hope in robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them. 

<sup>11</sup> 

God has spoken once, twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Also to You, O Lord, belong mercy and loving-kindness, for You render to every man according to his work.
