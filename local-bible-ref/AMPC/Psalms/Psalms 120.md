In my distress I cried to the Lord, and He answered me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips and from deceitful tongues. 

<sup>3</sup> 

What shall be given to you? Or what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue?-- 

<sup>4</sup> 

Sharp arrows of a [mighty] warrior, with [glowing] coals of the broom tree! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Woe is me that I sojourn with Meshech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar [as if among notoriously barbarous people]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

My life has too long had its dwelling with him who hates peace. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
