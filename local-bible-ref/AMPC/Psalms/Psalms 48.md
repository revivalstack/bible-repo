<sup>1</sup> 

Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Fair and beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth--Mount Zion [the City of David], to the northern side [Mount Moriah and the temple], the [whole] city of the Great King! 

<sup>3</sup> 

God has made Himself known in her palaces as a Refuge (a High Tower and a Stronghold). 

<sup>4</sup> 

For, behold, the kings assembled, they came onward and they passed away together. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They looked, they were amazed; they were stricken with terror and took to flight [affrighted and dismayed]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Trembling took hold of them there, and pain as of a woman in childbirth. 

<sup>7</sup> 

With the east wind You shattered the ships of Tarshish. 

<sup>8</sup> 

As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>9</sup> 

We have thought of Your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of Your temple. 

<sup>10</sup> 

As is Your name, O God, so is Your praise to the ends of the earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness (rightness and justice). 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of Your [righteous] judgments! 

<sup>12</sup> 

Walk about Zion, and go round about her, number her towers (her lofty and noble deeds of past days), 

<sup>13</sup> 

Consider well her ramparts, go through her palaces and citadels, that you may tell the next generation [and cease recalling disappointments]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For this God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide [even] until death.
