<sup>1</sup> 

Lord, who shall dwell [temporarily] in Your tabernacle? Who shall dwell [permanently] on Your holy hill? 

<sup>2</sup> 

He who walks and lives uprightly and blamelessly, who works rightness and justice and speaks and thinks the truth in his heart, 

<sup>3</sup> 

He who does not slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor; 

<sup>4</sup> 

In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he who honors those who fear the Lord (who revere and worship Him); who swears to his own hurt and does not change; 

<sup>5</sup> 

[He who] does not put out his money for interest [to one of his own people] and who will not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.
