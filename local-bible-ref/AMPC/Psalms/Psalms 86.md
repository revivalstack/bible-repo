<sup>1</sup> 

Incline Your ear, O Lord, and answer me, for I am poor and distressed, needy and desiring. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Preserve my life, for I am godly and dedicated; O my God, save Your servant, for I trust in You [leaning and believing on You, committing all and confidently looking to You, without fear or doubt]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Be merciful and gracious to me, O Lord, for to You do I cry all the day. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Make me, Your servant, to rejoice, O Lord, for to You do I lift myself up. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For You, O Lord, are good, and ready to forgive [our trespasses, sending them away, letting them go completely and forever]; and You are abundant in mercy and loving-kindness to all those who call upon You. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer; and listen to the cry of my supplications. 

<sup>7</sup> 

In the day of my trouble I will call on You, for You will answer me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

There is none like unto You among the gods, O Lord, neither are their works like unto Yours. 

<sup>9</sup> 

All nations whom You have made shall come and fall down before You, O Lord; and they shall glorify Your name. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For You are great and work wonders! You alone are God. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Teach me Your way, O Lord, that I may walk and live in Your truth; direct and unite my heart [solely, reverently] to fear and honor Your name. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I will confess and praise You, O Lord my God, with my whole (united) heart; and I will glorify Your name forevermore. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For great is Your mercy and loving-kindness toward me; and You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol [from the exceeding depths of affliction]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

O God, the proud and insolent are risen against me; a rabble of violent and ruthless men has sought and demanded my life, and they have not set You before them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

But You, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in mercy and loving-kindness and truth. 

<sup>16</sup> 

O turn to me and have mercy and be gracious to me; grant strength (might and inflexibility to temptation) to Your servant and save the son of Your handmaiden. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Show me a sign of [Your evident] goodwill and favor, that those who hate me may see it and be put to shame, because You, Lord, [will show Your approval of me when You] help and comfort me.
