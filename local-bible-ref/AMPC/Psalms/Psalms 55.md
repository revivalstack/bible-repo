<sup>1</sup> 

Listen to my prayer, O God, and hide not Yourself from my supplication! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Attend to me and answer me; I am restless and distraught in my complaint and must moan 

<sup>3</sup> 

[And I am distracted] at the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression and threats of the wicked; for they would cast trouble upon me, and in wrath they persecute me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

My heart is grievously pained within me, and the terrors of death have fallen upon me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Fear and trembling have come upon me; horror and fright have overwhelmed me. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And I say, Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Yes, I would wander far away, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>8</sup> 

I would hasten to escape and to find a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Destroy [their schemes], O Lord, confuse their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Day and night they go about on its walls; iniquity and mischief are in its midst. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Violence and ruin are within it; fraud and guile do not depart from its streets and marketplaces. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For it is not an enemy who reproaches and taunts me--then I might bear it; nor is it one who has hated me who insolently vaunts himself against me--then I might hide from him. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But it was you, a man my equal, my companion and my familiar friend. 

<sup>14</sup> 

We had sweet fellowship together and used to walk to the house of God in company. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Let desolations and death come suddenly upon them; let them go down alive to Sheol (the place of the dead), for evils are in their habitations, in their hearts, and their inmost part. 

<sup>16</sup> 

As for me, I will call upon God, and the Lord will save me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Evening and morning and at noon will I utter my complaint and moan and sigh, and He will hear my voice. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He has redeemed my life in peace from the battle that was against me [so that none came near me], for they were many who strove with me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

God will hear and humble them, even He Who abides of old--Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!--because in them there has been no change [of heart], and they do not fear, revere, and worship God. 

<sup>20</sup> 

[My companion] has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him; he has broken and profaned his agreement [of friendship and loyalty]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The words of his mouth were smoother than cream or butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Cast your burden on the Lord [releasing the weight of it] and He will sustain you; He will never allow the [consistently] righteous to be moved (made to slip, fall, or fail). 

<sup>23</sup> 

But You, O God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in, lean on, and confidently rely on You.
