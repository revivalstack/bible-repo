<sup>1</sup> 

In You, O Lord, do I put my trust and seek refuge; let me never be put to shame or [have my hope in You] disappointed; deliver me in Your righteousness! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Bow down Your ear to me, deliver me speedily! Be my Rock of refuge, a strong Fortress to save me! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Yes, You are my Rock and my Fortress; therefore for Your name's sake lead me and guide me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Draw me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, for You are my Strength and my Stronghold. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Into Your hands I commit my spirit; You have redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth and faithfulness. 

<sup>6</sup> 

[You and] I abhor those who pay regard to vain idols; but I trust in, rely on, and confidently lean on the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy and steadfast love, because You have seen my affliction, You have taken note of my life's distresses, 

<sup>8</sup> 

And You have not given me into the hand of the enemy; You have set my feet in a broad place. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Have mercy and be gracious unto me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; with grief my eye is weakened, also my inner self and my body. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For my life is spent with sorrow and my years with sighing; my strength has failed because of my iniquity, and even my bones have wasted away. 

<sup>11</sup> 

To all my enemies I have become a reproach, but especially to my neighbors, and a dread to my acquaintances, who flee from me on the street. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I am forgotten like a dead man, and out of mind; like a broken vessel am I. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For I have heard the slander of many; terror is on every side! While they schemed together against me, they plotted to take my life. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But I trusted in, relied on, and was confident in You, O Lord; I said, You are my God. 

<sup>15</sup> 

My times are in Your hands; deliver me from the hands of my foes and those who pursue me and persecute me. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Let Your face shine on Your servant; save me for Your mercy's sake and in Your loving-kindness. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Let me not be put to shame, O Lord, or disappointed, for I am calling upon You; let the wicked be put to shame, let them be silent in Sheol (the place of the dead). 

<sup>18</sup> 

Let the lying lips be silenced, which speak insolently against the [consistently] righteous with pride and contempt. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Oh, how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear, revere, and worship You, goodness which You have wrought for those who trust and take refuge in You before the sons of men! 

<sup>20</sup> 

In the secret place of Your presence You hide them from the plots of men; You keep them secretly in Your pavilion from the strife of tongues. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord! For He has shown me His marvelous loving favor when I was beset as in a besieged city. 

<sup>22</sup> 

As for me, I said in my haste and alarm, I am cut off from before Your eyes. But You heard the voice of my supplications when I cried to You for aid. 

<sup>23</sup> 

O love the Lord, all you His saints! The Lord preserves the faithful, and plentifully pays back him who deals haughtily. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Be strong and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for and hope for and expect the Lord!
