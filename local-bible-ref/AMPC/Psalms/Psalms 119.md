<sup>1</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are the undefiled (the upright, truly sincere, and blameless) in the way [of the revealed will of God], who walk (order their conduct and conversation) in the law of the Lord (the whole of God's revealed will). 

<sup>2</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are they who keep His testimonies, and who seek, inquire for and of Him and crave Him with the whole heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Yes, they do no unrighteousness [no willful wandering from His precepts]; they walk in His ways. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You have commanded us to keep Your precepts, that we should observe them diligently. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Oh, that my ways were directed and established to observe Your statutes [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then shall I not be put to shame [by failing to inherit Your promises] when I have respect to all Your commandments. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I will praise and give thanks to You with uprightness of heart when I learn [by sanctified experiences] Your righteous judgments [Your decisions against and punishments for particular lines of thought and conduct]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I will keep Your statutes; O forsake me not utterly. 

<sup>9</sup> 

How shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed and keeping watch [on himself] according to Your word [conforming his life to it]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

With my whole heart have I sought You, inquiring for and of You and yearning for You; Oh, let me not wander or step aside [either in ignorance or willfully] from Your commandments. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Your word have I laid up in my heart, that I might not sin against You. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Blessed are You, O Lord; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>13</sup> 

With my lips have I declared and recounted all the ordinances of Your mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies as much as in all riches. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I will meditate on Your precepts and have respect to Your ways [the paths of life marked out by Your law]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget Your word. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Deal bountifully with Your servant, that I may live; and I will observe Your word [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your law. 

<sup>19</sup> 

I am a stranger and a temporary resident on the earth; hide not Your commandments from me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

My heart is breaking with the longing that it has for Your ordinances and judgments at all times. 

<sup>21</sup> 

You rebuke the proud and arrogant, the accursed ones, who err and wander from Your commandments. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Take away from me reproach and contempt, for I keep Your testimonies. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Princes also sat and talked against me, but Your servant meditated on Your statutes. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Your testimonies also are my delight and my counselors. 

<sup>25</sup> 

My earthly life cleaves to the dust; revive and stimulate me according to Your word! 

<sup>26</sup> 

I have declared my ways and opened my griefs to You, and You listened to me; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Make me understand the way of Your precepts; so shall I meditate on and talk of Your wondrous works. 

<sup>28</sup> 

My life dissolves and weeps itself away for heaviness; raise me up and strengthen me according to [the promises of] Your word. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Remove from me the way of falsehood and unfaithfulness [to You], and graciously impart Your law to me. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I have chosen the way of truth and faithfulness; Your ordinances have I set before me. 

<sup>31</sup> 

I cleave to Your testimonies; O Lord, put me not to shame! 

<sup>32</sup> 

I will [not merely walk, but] run the way of Your commandments, when You give me a heart that is willing. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Teach me, O Lord, the way of Your statutes, and I will keep it to the end [steadfastly]. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Give me understanding, that I may keep Your law; yes, I will observe it with my whole heart. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Make me go in the path of Your commandments, for in them do I delight. 

<sup>36</sup> 

Incline my heart to Your testimonies and not to covetousness (robbery, sensuality, unworthy riches). 

<sup>37</sup> 

Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity (idols and idolatry); and restore me to vigorous life and health in Your ways. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Establish Your word and confirm Your promise to Your servant, which is for those who reverently fear and devotedly worship You. 

<sup>39</sup> 

Turn away my reproach which I fear and dread, for Your ordinances are good. 

<sup>40</sup> 

Behold, I long for Your precepts; in Your righteousness give me renewed life. 

<sup>41</sup> 

Let Your mercy and loving-kindness come also to me, O Lord, even Your salvation according to Your promise; 

<sup>42</sup> 

Then shall I have an answer for those who taunt and reproach me, for I lean on, rely on, and trust in Your word. 

<sup>43</sup> 

And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for I hope in Your ordinances. 

<sup>44</sup> 

I will keep Your law continually, forever and ever [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. 

<sup>45</sup> 

And I will walk at liberty and at ease, for I have sought and inquired for [and desperately required] Your precepts. 

<sup>46</sup> 

I will speak of Your testimonies also before kings and will not be put to shame. 

<sup>47</sup> 

For I will delight myself in Your commandments, which I love. 

<sup>48</sup> 

My hands also will I lift up [in fervent supplication] to Your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on Your statutes. 

<sup>49</sup> 

Remember [fervently] the word and promise to Your servant, in which You have caused me to hope. 

<sup>50</sup> 

This is my comfort and consolation in my affliction: that Your word has revived me and given me life. 

<sup>51</sup> 

The proud have had me greatly in derision, yet have I not declined in my interest in or turned aside from Your law. 

<sup>52</sup> 

When I have [earnestly] recalled Your ordinances from of old, O Lord, I have taken comfort. 

<sup>53</sup> 

Burning indignation, terror, and sadness seize upon me because of the wicked, who forsake Your law. 

<sup>54</sup> 

Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 

<sup>55</sup> 

I have [earnestly] remembered Your name, O Lord, in the night, and I have observed Your law. 

<sup>56</sup> 

This I have had [as the gift of Your grace and as my reward]: that I have kept Your precepts [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>57</sup> 

You are my portion, O Lord; I have promised to keep Your words. 

<sup>58</sup> 

I entreated Your favor with my whole heart; be merciful and gracious to me according to Your promise. 

<sup>59</sup> 

I considered my ways; I turned my feet to [obey] Your testimonies. 

<sup>60</sup> 

I made haste and delayed not to keep Your commandments. 

<sup>61</sup> 

Though the cords of the wicked have enclosed and ensnared me, I have not forgotten Your law. 

<sup>62</sup> 

At midnight I will rise to give thanks to You because of Your righteous ordinances. 

<sup>63</sup> 

I am a companion of all those who fear, revere, and worship You, and of those who observe and give heed to Your precepts. 

<sup>64</sup> 

The earth, O Lord, is full of Your mercy and loving-kindness; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>65</sup> 

You have dealt well with Your servant, O Lord, according to Your promise. 

<sup>66</sup> 

Teach me good judgment, wise and right discernment, and knowledge, for I have believed (trusted, relied on, and clung to) Your commandments. 

<sup>67</sup> 

Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now Your word do I keep [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. 

<sup>68</sup> 

You are good and kind and do good; teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>69</sup> 

The arrogant and godless have put together a lie against me, but I will keep Your precepts with my whole heart. 

<sup>70</sup> 

Their hearts are as fat as grease [their minds are dull and brutal], but I delight in Your law. 

<sup>71</sup> 

It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn Your statutes. 

<sup>72</sup> 

The law from Your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces. 

<sup>73</sup> 

Your hands have made me, cunningly fashioned and established me; give me understanding, that I may learn Your commandments. 

<sup>74</sup> 

Those who reverently and worshipfully fear You will see me and be glad, because I have hoped in Your word and tarried for it. 

<sup>75</sup> 

I know, O Lord, that Your judgments are right and righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me. 

<sup>76</sup> 

Let, I pray You, Your merciful kindness and steadfast love be for my comfort, according to Your promise to Your servant. 

<sup>77</sup> 

Let Your tender mercy and loving-kindness come to me that I may live, for Your law is my delight! 

<sup>78</sup> 

Let the proud be put to shame, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause; but I will meditate on Your precepts. 

<sup>79</sup> 

Let those who reverently and worshipfully fear You turn to me, and those who have known Your testimonies. 

<sup>80</sup> 

Let my heart be sound (sincere and wholehearted and blameless) in Your statutes, that I may not be put to shame. 

<sup>81</sup> 

My soul languishes and grows faint for Your salvation, but I hope in Your word. 

<sup>82</sup> 

My eyes fail, watching for [the fulfillment of] Your promise. I say, When will You comfort me? 

<sup>83</sup> 

For I have become like a bottle [a wineskin blackened and shriveled] in the smoke [in which it hangs], yet do I not forget Your statutes. 

<sup>84</sup> 

How many are the days of Your servant [which he must endure]? When will You judge those who pursue and persecute me? 

<sup>85</sup> 

The godless and arrogant have dug pitfalls for me, men who do not conform to Your law. 

<sup>86</sup> 

All Your commandments are faithful and sure. [The godless] pursue and persecute me with falsehood; help me [Lord]! 

<sup>87</sup> 

They had almost consumed me upon earth, but I forsook not Your precepts. 

<sup>88</sup> 

According to Your steadfast love give life to me; then I will keep the testimony of Your mouth [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. 

<sup>89</sup> 

Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven [stands firm as the heavens]. 

<sup>90</sup> 

Your faithfulness is from generation to generation; You have established the earth, and it stands fast. 

<sup>91</sup> 

All [the whole universe] are Your servants; therefore they continue this day according to Your ordinances. 

<sup>92</sup> 

Unless Your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction. 

<sup>93</sup> 

I will never forget Your precepts, [how can I?] for it is by them You have quickened me (granted me life). 

<sup>94</sup> 

I am Yours, therefore save me [Your own]; for I have sought (inquired of and for) Your precepts and required them [as my urgent need]. 

<sup>95</sup> 

The wicked wait for me to destroy me, but I will consider Your testimonies. 

<sup>96</sup> 

I have seen that everything [human] has its limits and end [no matter how extensive, noble, and excellent]; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad and extends without limits [into eternity]. 

<sup>97</sup> 

Oh, how love I Your law! It is my meditation all the day. 

<sup>98</sup> 

You, through Your commandments, make me wiser than my enemies, for [Your words] are ever before me. 

<sup>99</sup> 

I have better understanding and deeper insight than all my teachers, because Your testimonies are my meditation. 

<sup>100</sup> 

I understand more than the aged, because I keep Your precepts [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>101</sup> 

I have restrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep Your word [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it]. 

<sup>102</sup> 

I have not turned aside from Your ordinances, for You Yourself have taught me. 

<sup>103</sup> 

How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 

<sup>104</sup> 

Through Your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. 

<sup>105</sup> 

Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. 

<sup>106</sup> 

I have sworn [an oath] and have confirmed it, that I will keep Your righteous ordinances [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>107</sup> 

I am sorely afflicted; renew and quicken me [give me life], O Lord, according to Your word! 

<sup>108</sup> 

Accept, I beseech You, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me Your ordinances. 

<sup>109</sup> 

My life is continually in my hand, yet I do not forget Your law. 

<sup>110</sup> 

The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I do not stray from Your precepts. 

<sup>111</sup> 

Your testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 

<sup>112</sup> 

I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes forever, even to the end. 

<sup>113</sup> 

I hate the thoughts of undecided [in religion], double-minded people, but Your law do I love. 

<sup>114</sup> 

You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in Your word. 

<sup>115</sup> 

Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>116</sup> 

Uphold me according to Your promise, that I may live; and let me not be put to shame in my hope! 

<sup>117</sup> 

Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for Your statutes continually! 

<sup>118</sup> 

You spurn and set at nought all those who stray from Your statutes, for their own lying deceives them and their tricks are in vain. 

<sup>119</sup> 

You put away and count as dross all the wicked of the earth [for there is no true metal in them]; therefore I love Your testimonies. 

<sup>120</sup> 

My flesh trembles and shudders for fear and reverential, worshipful awe of You, and I am afraid and in dread of Your judgments. 

<sup>121</sup> 

I have done justice and righteousness; leave me not to those who would oppress me. 

<sup>122</sup> 

Be surety for Your servant for good [as Judah was surety for the safety of Benjamin]; let not the proud oppress me. 

<sup>123</sup> 

My eyes fail, watching for Your salvation and for the fulfillment of Your righteous promise. 

<sup>124</sup> 

Deal with Your servant according to Your mercy and loving-kindness, and teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>125</sup> 

I am Your servant; give me understanding (discernment and comprehension), that I may know (discern and be familiar with the character of) Your testimonies. 

<sup>126</sup> 

It is time for the Lord to act; they have frustrated Your law. 

<sup>127</sup> 

Therefore I love Your commandments more than [resplendent] gold, yes, more than [perfectly] refined gold. 

<sup>128</sup> 

Therefore I esteem as right all, yes, all Your precepts; I hate every false way. 

<sup>129</sup> 

Your testimonies are wonderful [far exceeding anything conceived by man]; therefore my [penitent] self keeps them [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>130</sup> 

The entrance and unfolding of Your words give light; their unfolding gives understanding (discernment and comprehension) to the simple. 

<sup>131</sup> 

I opened my mouth and panted [with eager desire], for I longed for Your commandments. 

<sup>132</sup> 

Look upon me, be merciful unto me, and show me favor, as is Your way to those who love Your name. 

<sup>133</sup> 

Establish my steps and direct them by [means of] Your word; let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 

<sup>134</sup> 

Deliver me from the oppression of man; so will I keep Your precepts [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>135</sup> 

Make Your face shine [with pleasure] upon Your servant, and teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>136</sup> 

Streams of water run down my eyes, because men do not keep Your law [they hear it not, nor receive it, love it, or obey it]. 

<sup>137</sup> 

[Rigidly] righteous are You, O Lord, and upright are Your judgments and all expressions of Your will. 

<sup>138</sup> 

You have commanded and appointed Your testimonies in righteousness and in great faithfulness. 

<sup>139</sup> 

My zeal has consumed me and cut me off, because my adversaries have forgotten Your words. 

<sup>140</sup> 

Your word is very pure (tried and well refined); therefore Your servant loves it. 

<sup>141</sup> 

I am small (insignificant) and despised, but I do not forget Your precepts. 

<sup>142</sup> 

Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your law is truth. 

<sup>143</sup> 

Trouble and anguish have found and taken hold on me, yet Your commandments are my delight. 

<sup>144</sup> 

Your righteous testimonies are everlasting and Your decrees are binding to eternity; give me understanding and I shall live [give me discernment and comprehension and I shall not die]. 

<sup>145</sup> 

I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O Lord; I will keep Your statutes [I will hear, receive, love, and obey them]. 

<sup>146</sup> 

I cried to You; save me, that I may keep Your testimonies [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. 

<sup>147</sup> 

I anticipated the dawning of the morning and cried [in childlike prayer]; I hoped in Your word. 

<sup>148</sup> 

My eyes anticipate the night watches and I am awake before the cry of the watchman, that I may meditate on Your word. 

<sup>149</sup> 

Hear my voice according to Your steadfast love; O Lord, quicken me and give me life according to Your [righteous] decrees. 

<sup>150</sup> 

They draw near who follow after wrong thinking and persecute me with wickedness; they are far from Your law. 

<sup>151</sup> 

You are near, O Lord [nearer to me than my foes], and all Your commandments are truth. 

<sup>152</sup> 

Of old have I known Your testimonies, and for a long time, [therefore it is a thoroughly established conviction] that You have founded them forever. 

<sup>153</sup> 

Consider my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget Your law. 

<sup>154</sup> 

Plead my cause and redeem me; revive me and give me life according to Your word. 

<sup>155</sup> 

Salvation is far from the wicked, for they seek not nor hunger for Your statutes. 

<sup>156</sup> 

Great are Your tender mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord; give me life according to Your ordinances. 

<sup>157</sup> 

Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, yet I do not swerve from Your testimonies. 

<sup>158</sup> 

I behold the treacherous and am grieved and loathe them, because they do not respect Your law [neither hearing, receiving, loving, nor obeying it]. 

<sup>159</sup> 

Consider how I love Your precepts; revive me and give life to me, O Lord, according to Your loving-kindness! 

<sup>160</sup> 

The sum of Your word is truth [the total of the full meaning of all Your individual precepts]; and every one of Your righteous decrees endures forever. 

<sup>161</sup> 

Princes pursue and persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of Your words [dreading violation of them far more than the force of prince or potentate]. 

<sup>162</sup> 

I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great spoil. 

<sup>163</sup> 

I hate and abhor falsehood, but Your law do I love. 

<sup>164</sup> 

Seven times a day and all day long do I praise You because of Your righteous decrees. 

<sup>165</sup> 

Great peace have they who love Your law; nothing shall offend them or make them stumble. 

<sup>166</sup> 

I am hoping and waiting [eagerly] for Your salvation, O Lord, and I do Your commandments. 

<sup>167</sup> 

Your testimonies have I kept [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]; I love them exceedingly! 

<sup>168</sup> 

I have observed Your precepts and Your testimonies, for all my ways are [fully known] before You. 

<sup>169</sup> 

Let my mournful cry and supplication come [near] before You, O Lord; give me understanding (discernment and comprehension) according to Your word [of assurance and promise]. 

<sup>170</sup> 

Let my supplication come before You; deliver me according to Your word! 

<sup>171</sup> 

My lips shall pour forth praise [with thanksgiving and renewed trust] when You teach me Your statutes. 

<sup>172</sup> 

My tongue shall sing [praise for the fulfillment] of Your word, for all Your commandments are righteous. 

<sup>173</sup> 

Let Your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen Your precepts. 

<sup>174</sup> 

I have longed for Your salvation, O Lord, and Your law is my delight. 

<sup>175</sup> 

Let me live that I may praise You, and let Your decrees help me. 

<sup>176</sup> 

I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek, inquire for, and demand Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments.
