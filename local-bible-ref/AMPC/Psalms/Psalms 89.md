<sup>1</sup> 

I will sing of the mercy and loving-kindness of the Lord forever; with my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness from generation to generation. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For I have said, Mercy and loving-kindness shall be built up forever; Your faithfulness will You establish in the very heavens [unchangeable and perpetual]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

[You have said] I have made a covenant with My chosen one, I have sworn to David My servant, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your Seed I will establish forever, and I will build up your throne for all generations. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let heaven (the angels) praise Your wonders, O Lord, Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones (the holy angels). 

<sup>6</sup> 

For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord? Who among the mighty [heavenly beings] can be likened to the Lord, 

<sup>7</sup> 

A God greatly feared and revered in the council of the holy (angelic) ones, and to be feared and worshipfully revered above all those who are round about Him? 

<sup>8</sup> 

O Lord God of hosts, who is a mighty one like unto You, O Lord? And Your faithfulness is round about You [an essential part of You at all times]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves arise, You still them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You have broken Rahab (Egypt) in pieces; with Your mighty arm You have scattered Your enemies. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours; the world and all that is in it, You have founded them. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The north and the south, You have created them; Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon joyously praise Your name. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, Your right hand is soaring high. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and loving-kindness and truth go before Your face. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are the people who know the joyful sound [who understand and appreciate the spiritual blessings symbolized by the feasts]; they walk, O Lord, in the light and favor of Your countenance! 

<sup>16</sup> 

In Your name they rejoice all the day, and in Your righteousness they are exalted. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For You are the glory of their strength [their proud adornment], and by Your favor our horn is exalted and we walk with uplifted faces! 

<sup>18</sup> 

For our shield belongs to the Lord, and our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Once You spoke in a vision to Your devoted ones and said, I have endowed one who is mighty [a hero, giving him the power to help--to be a champion for Israel]; I have exalted one chosen from among the people. 

<sup>20</sup> 

I have found David My servant; with My holy oil have I anointed him, 

<sup>21</sup> 

With whom My hand shall be established and ever abide; My arm also shall strengthen him. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The enemy shall not exact from him or do him violence or outwit him, nor shall the wicked afflict and humble him. 

<sup>23</sup> 

I will beat down his foes before his face and smite those who hate him. 

<sup>24</sup> 

My faithfulness and My mercy and loving-kindness shall be with him, and in My name shall his horn be exalted [great power and prosperity shall be conferred upon him]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

I will set his hand in control also on the [Mediterranean] Sea, and his right hand on the rivers [Euphrates with its tributaries]. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He shall cry to Me, You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation! 

<sup>27</sup> 

Also I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 

<sup>28</sup> 

My mercy and loving-kindness will I keep for him forevermore, and My covenant shall stand fast and be faithful with him. 

<sup>29</sup> 

His Offspring also will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 

<sup>30</sup> 

If his children forsake My law and walk not in My ordinances, 

<sup>31</sup> 

If they break or profane My statutes and keep not My commandments, 

<sup>32</sup> 

Then will I punish their transgression with the rod [of chastisement], and their iniquity with stripes. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Nevertheless, My loving-kindness will I not break off from him, nor allow My faithfulness to fail [to lie and be false to him]. 

<sup>34</sup> 

My covenant will I not break or profane, nor alter the thing that is gone out of My lips. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Once [for all] have I sworn by My holiness, which cannot be violated; I will not lie to David: 

<sup>36</sup> 

His Offspring shall endure forever, and his throne [shall continue] as the sun before Me. 

<sup>37</sup> 

It shall be established forever as the moon, the faithful witness in the heavens. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>38</sup> 

But [in apparent contradiction to all this] You [even You the faithful Lord] have cast off and rejected; You have been full of wrath against Your anointed. 

<sup>39</sup> 

You have despised and loathed and renounced the covenant with Your servant; You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 

<sup>40</sup> 

You have broken down all his hedges and his walls; You have brought his strongholds to ruin. 

<sup>41</sup> 

All who pass along the road spoil and rob him; he has become the scorn and reproach of his neighbors. 

<sup>42</sup> 

You have exalted the right hand of his foes; You have made all his enemies rejoice. 

<sup>43</sup> 

Moreover, You have turned back the edge of his sword and have not made him to stand in battle. 

<sup>44</sup> 

You have made his glory and splendor to cease and have hurled to the ground his throne. 

<sup>45</sup> 

The days of his youth have You shortened; You have covered him with shame. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>46</sup> 

How long, O Lord? Will You hide Yourself forever? How long shall Your wrath burn like fire? 

<sup>47</sup> 

O [earnestly] remember how short my time is and what a mere fleeting life mine is. For what emptiness, falsity, futility, and frailty You have created all men! 

<sup>48</sup> 

What man can live and shall not see death, or can deliver himself from the [powerful] hand of Sheol (the place of the dead)? Selah [pause, and calmly consider that]! 

<sup>49</sup> 

Lord, where are Your former loving-kindnesses [shown in the reigns of David and Solomon], which You swore to David in Your faithfulness? 

<sup>50</sup> 

Remember, Lord, and earnestly imprint [on Your heart] the reproach of Your servants, scorned and insulted, how I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many and mighty peoples, 

<sup>51</sup> 

With which Your enemies have taunted, O Lord, with which they have mocked the footsteps of Your anointed. 

<sup>52</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord forevermore! Amen and Amen.
