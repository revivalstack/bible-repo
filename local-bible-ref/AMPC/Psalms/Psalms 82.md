<sup>1</sup> 

God stands in the assembly [of the representatives] of God; in the midst of the magistrates or judges He gives judgment [as] among the gods. 

<sup>2</sup> 

How long will you [magistrates or judges] judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Do justice to the weak (poor) and fatherless; maintain the rights of the afflicted and needy. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Deliver the poor and needy; rescue them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>5</sup> 

[The magistrates and judges] know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in the darkness [of complacent satisfaction]; all the foundations of the earth [the fundamental principles upon which rests the administration of justice] are shaking. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I said, You are gods [since you judge on My behalf, as My representatives]; indeed, all of you are children of the Most High. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But you shall die as men and fall as one of the princes. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Arise, O God, judge the earth! For to You belong all the nations.
