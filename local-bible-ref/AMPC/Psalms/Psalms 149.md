<sup>1</sup> 

Praise the Lord! Sing to the Lord a new song, praise Him in the assembly of His saints! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let Israel rejoice in Him, their Maker; let Zion's children triumph and be joyful in their King! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Let them praise His name in chorus and choir and with the [single or group] dance; let them sing praises to Him with the tambourine and lyre! 

<sup>4</sup> 

For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation and adorn the wretched with victory. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let the saints be joyful in the glory and beauty [which God confers upon them]; let them sing for joy upon their beds. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Let the high praises of God be in their throats and a two-edged sword in their hands, 

<sup>7</sup> 

To wreak vengeance upon the nations and chastisement upon the peoples, 

<sup>8</sup> 

To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron, 

<sup>9</sup> 

To execute upon them the judgment written. He [the Lord] is the honor of all His saints. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
