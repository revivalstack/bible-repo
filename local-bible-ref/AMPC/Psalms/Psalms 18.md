<sup>1</sup> 

I love You fervently and devotedly, O Lord, my Strength. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord is my Rock, my Fortress, and my Deliverer; my God, my keen and firm Strength in Whom I will trust and take refuge, my Shield, and the Horn of my salvation, my High Tower. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I will call upon the Lord, Who is to be praised; so shall I be saved from my enemies. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The cords or bands of death surrounded me, and the streams of ungodliness and the torrents of ruin terrified me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The cords of Sheol (the place of the dead) surrounded me; the snares of death confronted and came upon me. 

<sup>6</sup> 

In my distress [when seemingly closed in] I called upon the Lord and cried to my God; He heard my voice out of His temple (heavenly dwelling place), and my cry came before Him, into His [very] ears. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then the earth quaked and rocked, the foundations also of the mountains trembled; they moved and were shaken because He was indignant and angry. 

<sup>8</sup> 

There went up smoke from His nostrils; and lightning out of His mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He bowed the heavens also and came down; and thick darkness was under His feet. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And He rode upon a cherub [a storm] and flew [swiftly]; yes, He sped on with the wings of the wind. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He made darkness His secret hiding place; as His pavilion (His canopy) round about Him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Out of the brightness before Him there broke forth through His thick clouds hailstones and coals of fire. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The Lord also thundered from the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice, amid hailstones and coals of fire. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And He sent out His arrows and scattered them; and He flashed forth lightnings and put them to rout. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then the beds of the sea appeared and the foundations of the world were laid bare at Your rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He reached from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He delivered me from my strong enemy and from those who hated and abhorred me, for they were too strong for me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

They confronted and came upon me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my stay and support. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He brought me forth also into a large place; He was delivering me because He was pleased with me and delighted in me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness (my conscious integrity and sincerity with Him); according to the cleanness of my hands has He recompensed me. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For all His ordinances were before me, and I put not away His statutes from me. 

<sup>23</sup> 

I was upright before Him and blameless with Him, ever [on guard] to keep myself free from my sin and guilt. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Therefore has the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness (my uprightness and right standing with Him), according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight. 

<sup>25</sup> 

With the kind and merciful You will show Yourself kind and merciful, with an upright man You will show Yourself upright, 

<sup>26</sup> 

With the pure You will show Yourself pure, and with the perverse You will show Yourself contrary. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For You deliver an afflicted and humble people but will bring down those with haughty looks. 

<sup>28</sup> 

For You cause my lamp to be lighted and to shine; the Lord my God illumines my darkness. 

<sup>29</sup> 

For by You I can run through a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall. 

<sup>30</sup> 

As for God, His way is perfect! The word of the Lord is tested and tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge and put their trust in Him. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For who is God except the Lord? Or who is the Rock save our God, 

<sup>32</sup> 

The God who girds me with strength and makes my way perfect? 

<sup>33</sup> 

He makes my feet like hinds' feet [able to stand firmly or make progress on the dangerous heights of testing and trouble]; He sets me securely upon my high places. 

<sup>34</sup> 

He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 

<sup>35</sup> 

You have also given me the shield of Your salvation, and Your right hand has held me up; Your gentleness and condescension have made me great. 

<sup>36</sup> 

You have given plenty of room for my steps under me, that my feet would not slip. 

<sup>37</sup> 

I pursued my enemies and overtook them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 

<sup>38</sup> 

I smote them so that they were not able to rise; they fell wounded under my feet. 

<sup>39</sup> 

For You have girded me with strength for the battle; You have subdued under me and caused to bow down those who rose up against me. 

<sup>40</sup> 

You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me. 

<sup>41</sup> 

They cried [for help], but there was none to deliver--even unto the Lord, but He answered them not. 

<sup>42</sup> 

Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I emptied them out as the dirt and mire of the streets. 

<sup>43</sup> 

You have delivered me from the strivings of the people; You made me the head of the nations; a people I had not known served me. 

<sup>44</sup> 

As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me; foreigners submitted themselves cringingly and yielded feigned obedience to me. 

<sup>45</sup> 

Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their caves or strongholds. 

<sup>46</sup> 

The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted, 

<sup>47</sup> 

The God Who avenges me and subdues peoples under me, 

<sup>48</sup> 

Who delivers me from my enemies; yes, You lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the man of violence. 

<sup>49</sup> 

Therefore will I give thanks and extol You, O Lord, among the nations, and sing praises to Your name. 

<sup>50</sup> 

Great deliverances and triumphs gives He to His king; and He shows mercy and steadfast love to His anointed, to David and his offspring forever.
