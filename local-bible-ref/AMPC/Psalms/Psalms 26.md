<sup>1</sup> 

Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity; I have [expectantly] trusted in, leaned on, and relied on the Lord without wavering and I shall not slide. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; test my heart and my mind. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For Your loving-kindness is before my eyes, and I have walked in Your truth [faithfully]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

I do not sit with false persons, nor fellowship with pretenders; 

<sup>5</sup> 

I hate the company of evildoers and will not sit with the wicked. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I will wash my hands in innocence, and go about Your altar, O Lord, 

<sup>7</sup> 

That I may make the voice of thanksgiving heard and may tell of all Your wondrous works. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Lord, I love the habitation of Your house, and the place where Your glory dwells. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Gather me not with sinners and sweep me not away [with them], nor my life with bloodthirsty men, 

<sup>10</sup> 

In whose hands is wickedness, and their right hands are full of bribes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But as for me, I will walk in my integrity; redeem me and be merciful and gracious to me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

My foot stands on an even place; in the congregations will I bless the Lord.
