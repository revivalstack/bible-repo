<sup>1</sup> 

When the Lord brought back the captives [who returned] to Zion, we were like those who dream [it seemed so unreal]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then were our mouths filled with laughter, and our tongues with singing. Then they said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The Lord has done great things for us! We are glad! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Turn to freedom our captivity and restore our fortunes, O Lord, as the streams in the South (the Negeb) [are restored by the torrents]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They who sow in tears shall reap in joy and singing. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He who goes forth bearing seed and weeping [at needing his precious supply of grain for sowing] shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
