<sup>1</sup> 

I cry to the Lord with my voice; with my voice to the Lord do I make supplication. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I pour out my complaint before Him; I tell before Him my trouble. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When my spirit was overwhelmed and fainted [throwing all its weight] upon me, then You knew my path. In the way where I walk they have hidden a snare for me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Look on the right hand [the point of attack] and see; for there is no man who knows me [to appear for me]. Refuge has failed me and I have no way to flee; no man cares for my life or my welfare. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I cried to You, O Lord; I said, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Attend to my loud cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Bring my life out of prison, that I may confess, praise, and give thanks to Your name; the righteous will surround me and crown themselves because of me, for You will deal bountifully with me.
