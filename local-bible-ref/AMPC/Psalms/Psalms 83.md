Keep not silence, O God; hold not Your peace or be still, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For, behold, Your enemies are in tumult, and those who hate You have raised their heads. 

<sup>3</sup> 

They lay crafty schemes against Your people and consult together against Your hidden and precious ones. 

<sup>4</sup> 

They have said, Come, and let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be in remembrance no more. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For they have consulted together with one accord and one heart; against You they make a covenant-- 

<sup>6</sup> 

The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Assyria also has joined with them; they have helped the children of Lot [the Ammonites and the Moabites] and have been an arm to them. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Do to them as [You did to] the Midianites, as to Sisera and Jabin at the brook of Kishon, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who perished at Endor, who became like manure for the earth. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, yes, all their princes as Zebah and Zalmunna, 

<sup>12</sup> 

Who say, Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God. 

<sup>13</sup> 

O my God, make them like whirling dust, like stubble or chaff before the wind! 

<sup>14</sup> 

As fire consumes the forest, and as the flame sets the mountains ablaze, 

<sup>15</sup> 

So pursue and afflict them with Your tempest and terrify them with Your tornado or hurricane. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek, inquire for, and insistently require Your name, O Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; yes, let them be put to shame and perish, 

<sup>18</sup> 

That they may know that You, Whose name alone is the Lord, are the Most High over all the earth.
