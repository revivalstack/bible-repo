<sup>1</sup> 

The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles and coastlands be glad! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Clouds and darkness are round about Him [as at Sinai]; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Fire goes before Him and burns up His adversaries round about. 

<sup>4</sup> 

His lightnings illumine the world; the earth sees and trembles. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The heavens declare His righteousness, and all the peoples see His glory. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let all those be put to shame who serve graven images, who boast in idols. Fall prostrate before Him, all you gods. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced [in relief] because of Your judgments, O Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For You, Lord, are high above all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods. 

<sup>10</sup> 

O you who love the Lord, hate evil; He preserves the lives of His saints (the children of God), He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Light is sown for the [uncompromisingly] righteous and strewn along their pathway, and joy for the upright in heart [the irrepressible joy which comes from consciousness of His favor and protection]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Rejoice in the Lord, you [consistently] righteous (upright and in right standing with God), and give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness.
