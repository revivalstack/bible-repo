<sup>1</sup> 

Judge and vindicate me, O God; plead and defend my cause against an ungodly nation. O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man! 

<sup>2</sup> 

For You are the God of my strength [my Stronghold--in Whom I take refuge]; why have You cast me off? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

<sup>3</sup> 

O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; let them bring me to Your holy hill and to Your dwelling. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy; yes, with the lyre will I praise You, O God, my God! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me and be disquieted within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the help of my [sad] countenance, and my God.
