<sup>1</sup> 

I will cry to God with my voice, even to God with my voice, and He will give ear and hearken to me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

In the day of my trouble I seek (inquire of and desperately require) the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out [in prayer] without slacking up; I refuse to be comforted. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I [earnestly] remember God; I am disquieted and I groan; I muse in prayer, and my spirit faints [overwhelmed]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

You hold my eyes from closing; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I consider the days of old, the years of bygone times [of prosperity]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I call to remembrance my song in the night; with my heart I meditate and my spirit searches diligently: 

<sup>7</sup> 

Will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Have His mercy and loving-kindness ceased forever? Have His promises ended for all time? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Has God [deliberately] abandoned or forgotten His graciousness? Has He in anger shut up His compassion? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>10</sup> 

And I say, This [apparent desertion of Israel by God] is my appointed lot and trial, but I will recall the years of the right hand of the Most High [in loving-kindness extended toward us], for this is my grief, that the right hand of the Most High changes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

I will [earnestly] recall the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will [earnestly] remember the wonders [You performed for our fathers] of old. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I will meditate also upon all Your works and consider all Your [mighty] deeds. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary [in holiness, away from sin and guilt]. Who is a great God like our God? 

<sup>14</sup> 

You are the God Who does wonders; You have demonstrated Your power among the peoples. 

<sup>15</sup> 

You have with Your [mighty] arm redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>16</sup> 

When the waters [at the Red Sea and the Jordan] saw You, O God, they were afraid; the deep shuddered also, for [all] the waters saw You. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The clouds poured down water, the skies sent out a sound [of rumbling thunder]; Your arrows went forth [in forked lightning]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind, the lightnings illumined the world; the earth trembled and shook. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Your way [in delivering Your people] was through the sea, and Your paths through the great waters, yet Your footsteps were not traceable, but were obliterated. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
