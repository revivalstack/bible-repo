<sup>1</sup> 

I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will show forth (recount and tell aloud) all Your marvelous works and wonderful deeds! 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will rejoice in You and be in high spirits; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High! 

<sup>3</sup> 

When my enemies turned back, they stumbled and perished before You. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For You have maintained my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging righteously. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked; You have blotted out their name forever and ever. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The enemy have been cut off and have vanished in everlasting ruins, You have plucked up and overthrown their cities; the very memory of them has perished and vanished. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But the Lord shall remain and continue forever; He has prepared and established His throne for judgment. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And He will judge the world in righteousness (rightness and equity); He will minister justice to the peoples in uprightness. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The Lord also will be a refuge and a high tower for the oppressed, a refuge and a stronghold in times of trouble (high cost, destitution, and desperation). 

<sup>10</sup> 

And they who know Your name [who have experience and acquaintance with Your mercy] will lean on and confidently put their trust in You, for You, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek (inquire of and for) You [on the authority of God's Word and the right of their necessity]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Sing praises to the Lord, Who dwells in Zion! Declare among the peoples His doings! 

<sup>12</sup> 

For He Who avenges the blood [of His people shed unjustly] remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted (the poor and the humble). 

<sup>13</sup> 

Have mercy upon me and be gracious to me, O Lord; consider how I am afflicted by those who hate me, You Who lift me up from the gates of death, 

<sup>14</sup> 

That I may show forth (recount and tell aloud) all Your praises! In the gates of the Daughter of Zion I will rejoice in Your salvation and Your saving help. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot caught. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The Lord has made Himself known; He executes judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Higgaion [meditation]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>17</sup> 

The wicked shall be turned back [headlong into premature death] into Sheol (the place of the departed spirits of the wicked), even all the nations that forget or are forgetful of God. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the expectation and hope of the meek and the poor shall not perish forever. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Arise, O Lord! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before You. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Put them in fear [make them realize their frail nature], O Lord, that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]!
