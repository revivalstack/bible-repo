To You belongs silence (the submissive wonder of reverence which bursts forth into praise) and praise is due and fitting to You, O God, in Zion; and to You shall the vow be performed. 

<sup>2</sup> 

O You Who hear prayer, to You shall all flesh come. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Iniquities and much varied guilt prevail against me; [yet] as for our transgressions, You forgive and purge them away [make atonement for them and cover them out of Your sight]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man whom You choose and cause to come near, that he may dwell in Your courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house, Your holy temple. 

<sup>5</sup> 

By fearful and glorious things [that terrify the wicked but make the godly sing praises] do You answer us in righteousness (rightness and justice), O God of our salvation, You Who are the confidence and hope of all the ends of the earth and of those far off on the seas; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Who by [Your] might have founded the mountains, being girded with power, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Who still the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples, 

<sup>8</sup> 

So that those who dwell in earth's farthest parts are afraid of [nature's] signs of Your presence. You make the places where morning and evening have birth to shout for joy. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You visit the earth and saturate it with water; You greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; You provide them with grain when You have so prepared the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You water the field's furrows abundantly, You settle the ridges of it; You make the soil soft with showers, blessing the sprouting of its vegetation. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You crown the year with Your bounty and goodness, and the tracks of Your [chariot wheels] drip with fatness. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The [luxuriant] pastures in the uncultivated country drip [with moisture], and the hills gird themselves with joy. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The meadows are clothed with flocks, the valleys also are covered with grain; they shout for joy and sing together.
