<sup>1</sup> 

Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all you lands! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Serve the Lord with gladness! Come before His presence with singing! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Know (perceive, recognize, and understand with approval) that the Lord is God! It is He Who has made us, not we ourselves [and we are His]! We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.

Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and a thank offering and into His courts with praise! Be thankful and say so to Him, bless and affectionately praise His name! 

<sup>5</sup> 

For the Lord is good; His mercy and loving-kindness are everlasting, His faithfulness and truth endure to all generations.
