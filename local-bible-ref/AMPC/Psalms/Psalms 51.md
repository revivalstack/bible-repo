<sup>1</sup> 

Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your steadfast love; according to the multitude of Your tender mercy and loving-kindness blot out my transgressions. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Wash me thoroughly [and repeatedly] from my iniquity and guilt and cleanse me and make me wholly pure from my sin! 

<sup>3</sup> 

For I am conscious of my transgressions and I acknowledge them; my sin is ever before me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Against You, You only, have I sinned and done that which is evil in Your sight, so that You are justified in Your sentence and faultless in Your judgment. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Behold, I was brought forth in [a state of] iniquity; my mother was sinful who conceived me [and I too am sinful]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Behold, You desire truth in the inner being; make me therefore to know wisdom in my inmost heart. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean [ceremonially]; wash me, and I shall [in reality] be whiter than snow. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Make me to hear joy and gladness and be satisfied; let the bones which You have broken rejoice. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my guilt and iniquities. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right, persevering, and steadfast spirit within me. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Cast me not away from Your presence and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Restore to me the joy of Your salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then will I teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted and return to You. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Deliver me from bloodguiltiness and death, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness (Your rightness and Your justice). 

<sup>15</sup> 

O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For You delight not in sacrifice, or else would I give it; You find no pleasure in burnt offering. 

<sup>17</sup> 

My sacrifice [the sacrifice acceptable] to God is a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart [broken down with sorrow for sin and humbly and thoroughly penitent], such, O God, You will not despise. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then will You delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, justice, and right, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then bullocks will be offered upon Your altar.
