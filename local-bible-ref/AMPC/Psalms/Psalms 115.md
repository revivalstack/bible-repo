Not to us, O Lord, not to us but to Your name give glory, for Your mercy and loving-kindness and for the sake of Your truth and faithfulness! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Why should the nations say, Where is now their God? 

<sup>3</sup> 

But our God is in heaven; He does whatever He pleases. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

<sup>6</sup> 

They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but they smell not; 

<sup>7</sup> 

They have hands, but they handle not; feet have they, but they walk not; neither can they make a sound with their throats. 

<sup>8</sup> 

They who make idols are like them; so are all who trust in and lean on them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

O Israel, trust and take refuge in the Lord! [Lean on, rely on, and be confident in Him!] He is their Help and their Shield. 

<sup>10</sup> 

O house of Aaron [the priesthood], trust in and lean on the Lord! He is their Help and their Shield. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You who [reverently] fear the Lord, trust in and lean on the Lord! He is their Help and their Shield. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The Lord has been mindful of us, He will bless us: He will bless the house of Israel, He will bless the house of Aaron [the priesthood], 

<sup>13</sup> 

He will bless those who reverently and worshipfully fear the Lord, both small and great. 

<sup>14</sup> 

May the Lord give you increase more and more, you and your children. 

<sup>15</sup> 

May you be blessed of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth! 

<sup>16</sup> 

The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth has He given to the children of men. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The dead praise not the Lord, neither any who go down into silence. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But we will bless (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord from this time forth and forever. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
