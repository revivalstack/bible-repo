<sup>1</sup> 

Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend and protect me from those who rise up against me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Deliver me from and lift me above those who work evil and save me from bloodthirsty men. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For, behold, they lie in wait for my life; fierce and mighty men are banding together against me, not for my transgression nor for any sin of mine, O Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 

They run and prepare themselves, though there is no fault in me; rouse Yourself [O Lord] to meet and help me, and see! 

<sup>5</sup> 

You, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, arise to visit all the nations; spare none and be not merciful to any who treacherously plot evil. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

They return at evening, they howl and snarl like dogs, and go [prowling] about the city. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Behold, they belch out [insults] with their mouths; swords [of sarcasm, ridicule, slander, and lies] are in their lips, for who, they think, hears us? 

<sup>8</sup> 

But You, O Lord, will laugh at them [in scorn]; You will hold all the nations in derision. 

<sup>9</sup> 

O my Strength, I will watch and give heed to You and sing praises; for God is my Defense (my Protector and High Tower). 

<sup>10</sup> 

My God in His mercy and steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look [triumphantly] on my enemies (those who lie in wait for me). 

<sup>11</sup> 

Slay them not, lest my people forget; scatter them by Your power and make them wander to and fro, and bring them down, O Lord our Shield! 

<sup>12</sup> 

For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them even be trapped and taken in their pride, and for the cursing and lying which they utter. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Consume them in wrath, consume them so that they shall be no more; and let them know unto the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob (Israel). Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>14</sup> 

And at evening let them return; let them howl and snarl like dogs, and go prowling about the city. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Let them wander up and down for food and tarry all night if they are not satisfied (not getting their fill). 

<sup>16</sup> 

But I will sing of Your mighty strength and power; yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy and loving-kindness in the morning; for You have been to me a defense (a fortress and a high tower) and a refuge in the day of my distress. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Unto You, O my Strength, I will sing praises; for God is my Defense, my Fortress, and High Tower, the God Who shows me mercy and steadfast love.
