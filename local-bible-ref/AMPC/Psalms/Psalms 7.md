<sup>1</sup> 

O Lord my God, in You I take refuge and put my trust; save me from all those who pursue and persecute me, and deliver me, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Lest my foe tear my life [from my body] like a lion, dragging me away while there is none to deliver. 

<sup>3</sup> 

O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands, 

<sup>4</sup> 

If I have paid back with evil him who was at peace with me or without cause have robbed him who was my enemy, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let the enemy pursue my life and take it; yes, let him trample my life to the ground and lay my honor in the dust. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

Arise, O Lord, in Your anger; lift up Yourself against the rage of my enemies; and awake [and stir up] for me the justice and vindication [that] You have commanded. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about You, and return on high over them. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The Lord judges the people; judge me, O Lord, and do me justice according to my righteousness [my rightness, justice, and right standing with You] and according to the integrity that is in me. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish the [uncompromisingly] righteous [those upright and in harmony with You]; for You, Who try the hearts and emotions and thinking powers, are a righteous God. 

<sup>10</sup> 

My defense and shield depend on God, Who saves the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 

God is a righteous Judge, yes, a God Who is indignant every day. 

<sup>12</sup> 

If a man does not turn and repent, [God] will whet His sword; He has strung and bent His [huge] bow and made it ready [by treading it with His foot]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He has also prepared for him deadly weapons; He makes His arrows fiery shafts. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Behold, [the wicked man] conceives iniquity and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He made a pit and hollowed it out and has fallen into the hole which he made [before the trap was completed]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

His mischief shall fall back in return upon his own head, and his violence come down [with the loose dirt] upon his own scalp. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I will give to the Lord the thanks due to His rightness and justice, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.
