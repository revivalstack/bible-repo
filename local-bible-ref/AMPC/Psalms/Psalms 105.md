<sup>1</sup> 

O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon His name, make known His doings among the peoples! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Sing to Him, sing praises to Him; meditate on and talk of all His marvelous deeds and devoutly praise them. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Glory in His holy name; let the hearts of those rejoice who seek and require the Lord [as their indispensable necessity]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Seek, inquire of and for the Lord, and crave Him and His strength (His might and inflexibility to temptation); seek and require His face and His presence [continually] evermore. 

<sup>5</sup> 

[Earnestly] remember the marvelous deeds that He has done, His miracles and wonders, the judgments and sentences which He pronounced [upon His enemies, as in Egypt]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

O you offspring of Abraham His servant, you children of Jacob, His chosen ones, 

<sup>7</sup> 

He is the Lord our God; His judgments are in all the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He is [earnestly] mindful of His covenant and forever it is imprinted on His heart, the word which He commanded and established to a thousand generations, 

<sup>9</sup> 

The covenant which He made with Abraham, and His sworn promise to Isaac, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Which He confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 

<sup>11</sup> 

Saying, Unto you will I give the land of Canaan as your measured portion, possession, and inheritance. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When they were but a few men in number, in fact, very few, and were temporary residents and strangers in it, 

<sup>13</sup> 

When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people, 

<sup>14</sup> 

He allowed no man to do them wrong; in fact, He reproved kings for their sakes, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Saying, Touch not My anointed, and do My prophets no harm. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Moreover, He called for a famine upon the land [of Egypt]; He cut off every source of bread. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold as a servant. 

<sup>18</sup> 

His feet they hurt with fetters; he was laid in chains of iron and his soul entered into the iron, 

<sup>19</sup> 

Until his word [to his cruel brothers] came true, until the word of the Lord tried and tested him. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The king sent and loosed him, even the ruler of the peoples, and let him go free. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He made Joseph lord of his house and ruler of all his substance, 

<sup>22</sup> 

To bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his elders wisdom. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

<sup>24</sup> 

There [the Lord] greatly increased His people and made them stronger than their oppressors. 

<sup>25</sup> 

He turned the hearts [of the Egyptians] to hate His people, to deal craftily with His servants. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He sent Moses His servant, and Aaron, whom He had chosen. 

<sup>27</sup> 

They showed His signs among them, wonders and miracles in the land of Ham (Egypt). 

<sup>28</sup> 

He sent [thick] darkness and made the land dark, and they [God's two servants] rebelled not against His word. 

<sup>29</sup> 

He turned [Egypt's] waters into blood and caused their fish to die. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, even in the chambers of their kings. 

<sup>31</sup> 

He spoke, and there came swarms of beetles and flies and mosquitoes and lice in all their borders. 

<sup>32</sup> 

He gave them hail for rain, with lightning like flaming fire in their land. 

<sup>33</sup> 

He smote their vines also and their fig trees and broke the [ice-laden] trees of their borders. 

<sup>34</sup> 

He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, and that without number, 

<sup>35</sup> 

And ate up all the vegetation in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground. 

<sup>36</sup> 

He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the beginning and chief substance of all their strength. 

<sup>37</sup> 

He brought [Israel] forth also with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had fallen upon the people. 

<sup>39</sup> 

The Lord spread a cloud for a covering [by day], and a fire to give light in the night. 

<sup>40</sup> 

[The Israelites] asked, and He brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 

<sup>41</sup> 

He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it ran in the dry places like a river. 

<sup>42</sup> 

For He [earnestly] remembered His holy word and promise to Abraham His servant. 

<sup>43</sup> 

And He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen ones with gladness and singing, 

<sup>44</sup> 

And gave them the lands of the nations [of Canaan], and they reaped the fruits of those peoples' labor, 

<sup>45</sup> 

That they might observe His statutes and keep His laws [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying them]. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
