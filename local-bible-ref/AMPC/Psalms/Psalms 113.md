<sup>1</sup> 

Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!) Praise, O servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever 

<sup>3</sup> 

From the rising of the sun to the going down of it and from east to west, the name of the Lord is to be praised! 

<sup>4</sup> 

The Lord is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Who is like the Lord our God, Who has His seat on high, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Who humbles Himself to regard the heavens and the earth! 

<sup>7</sup> 

[The Lord] raises the poor out of the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap and the dung hill, 

<sup>8</sup> 

That He may seat them with princes, even with the princes of His people. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He makes the barren woman to be a homemaker and a joyful mother of [spiritual] children. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
