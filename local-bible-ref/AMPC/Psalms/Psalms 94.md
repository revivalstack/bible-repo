O Lord God, You to Whom vengeance belongs, O God, You to Whom vengeance belongs, shine forth! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render to the proud a fit compensation! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph and exult? 

<sup>4</sup> 

They pour out arrogant words, speaking hard things; all the evildoers boast loftily. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They crush Your people, O Lord, and afflict Your heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> 

They slay the widow and the transient stranger and murder the unprotected orphan. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Yet they say, The Lord does not see, neither does the God of Jacob notice it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Consider and understand, you stupid ones among the people! And you [self-confident] fools, when will you become wise? 

<sup>9</sup> 

He Who planted the ear, shall He not hear? He Who formed the eye, shall He not see? 

<sup>10</sup> 

He Who disciplines and instructs the nations, shall He not punish, He Who teaches man knowledge? 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they are vain (empty and futile--only a breath). 

<sup>12</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man whom You discipline and instruct, O Lord, and teach out of Your law, 

<sup>13</sup> 

That You may give him power to keep himself calm in the days of adversity, until the [inevitable] pit of corruption is dug for the wicked. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For the Lord will not cast off nor spurn His people, neither will He abandon His heritage. 

<sup>15</sup> 

For justice will return to the [uncompromisingly] righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>17</sup> 

Unless the Lord had been my help, I would soon have dwelt in [the land where there is] silence. 

<sup>18</sup> 

When I said, My foot is slipping, Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, held me up. 

<sup>19</sup> 

In the multitude of my [anxious] thoughts within me, Your comforts cheer and delight my soul! 

<sup>20</sup> 

Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with You--they who frame and hide their unrighteous doings under [the sacred name of] law? 

<sup>21</sup> 

They band themselves together against the life of the [consistently] righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 

<sup>22</sup> 

But the Lord has become my High Tower and Defense, and my God the Rock of my refuge. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And He will turn back upon them their own iniquity and will wipe them out by means of their own wickedness; the Lord our God will wipe them out.
