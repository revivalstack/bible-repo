Give the king [knowledge of] Your [way of] judging, O God, and [the spirit of] Your righteousness to the king's son [to control all his actions]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let him judge and govern Your people with righteousness, and Your poor and afflicted ones with judgment and justice. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the hills, through [the general establishment of] righteousness. 

<sup>4</sup> 

May he judge and defend the poor of the people, deliver the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor, 

<sup>5</sup> 

So that they may revere and fear You while the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations. 

<sup>6</sup> 

May he [Solomon as a type of King David's greater Son] be like rain that comes down upon the mown grass, like showers that water the earth. 

<sup>7</sup> 

In His [Christ's] days shall the [uncompromisingly] righteous flourish and peace abound till there is a moon no longer. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He [Christ] shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before Him and His enemies shall lick the dust. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The kings of Tarshish and of the coasts shall bring offerings; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him, all nations shall serve Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For He delivers the needy when he calls out, the poor also and him who has no helper. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He will have pity on the poor and weak and needy and will save the lives of the needy. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He will redeem their lives from oppression and fraud and violence, and precious and costly shall their blood be in His sight. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And He shall live; and to Him shall be given gold of Sheba; prayer also shall be made for Him and through Him continually, and they shall bless and praise Him all the day long. 

<sup>16</sup> 

There shall be abundance of grain in the soil upon the top of the mountains [the least fruitful places in the land]; the fruit of it shall wave like [the forests of] Lebanon, and [the inhabitants of] the city shall flourish like grass of the earth. 

<sup>17</sup> 

His name shall endure forever; His name shall continue as long as the sun [indeed, His name continues before the sun]. And men shall be blessed and bless themselves by Him; all nations shall call Him blessed! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, Who alone does wondrous things! 

<sup>19</sup> 

Blessed be His glorious name forever; let the whole earth be filled with His glory! Amen and Amen! 

<sup>20</sup> 

The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended.
