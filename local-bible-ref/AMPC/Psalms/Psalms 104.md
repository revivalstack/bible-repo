<sup>1</sup> 

Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, O my soul! O Lord my God, You are very great! You are clothed with honor and majesty-- 

<sup>2</sup> 

[You are the One] Who covers Yourself with light as with a garment, Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain or a tent, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Who lays the beams of the upper room of His abode in the waters [above the firmament], Who makes the clouds His chariot, Who walks on the wings of the wind, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who makes winds His messengers, flames of fire His ministers. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved forever. 

<sup>6</sup> 

You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. 

<sup>7</sup> 

At Your rebuke they fled; at the voice of Your thunder they hastened away. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place which You appointed for them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You have set a boundary [for the waters] which they may not pass over, that they turn not again to deluge the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He sends forth springs into the valleys; their waters run among the mountains. 

<sup>11</sup> 

They give drink to every [wild] beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst there. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Beside them the birds of the heavens have their nests; they sing among the branches. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He waters the mountains from His upper rooms; the earth is satisfied and abounds with the fruit of His works. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He causes vegetation to grow for the cattle, and all that the earth produces for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food out of the earth-- 

<sup>15</sup> 

And wine that gladdens the heart of man, to make his face shine more than oil, and bread to support, refresh, and strengthen man's heart. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly and are filled with sap, the cedars of Lebanon which He has planted, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Where the birds make their nests; as for the stork, the fir trees are her house. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the conies and badgers. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[The Lord] appointed the moon for the seasons; the sun knows [the exact time of] its setting. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You [O Lord] make darkness and it becomes night, in which creeps forth every wild beast of the forest. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God. 

<sup>22</sup> 

When the sun arises, they withdraw themselves and lie down in their dens. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Man goes forth to his work and remains at his task until evening. 

<sup>24</sup> 

O Lord, how many and varied are Your works! In wisdom have You made them all; the earth is full of Your riches and Your creatures. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Yonder is the sea, great and wide, in which are swarms of innumerable creeping things, creatures both small and great. 

<sup>26</sup> 

There go the ships of the sea, and Leviathan (the sea monster), which You have formed to sport in it. 

<sup>27</sup> 

These all wait and are dependent upon You, that You may give them their food in due season. 

<sup>28</sup> 

When You give it to them, they gather it up; You open Your hand, and they are filled with good things. 

<sup>29</sup> 

When You hide Your face, they are troubled and dismayed; when You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. 

<sup>30</sup> 

When You send forth Your Spirit and give them breath, they are created, and You replenish the face of the ground. 

<sup>31</sup> 

May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in His works-- 

<sup>32</sup> 

Who looks on the earth, and it quakes and trembles, Who touches the mountains, and they smoke! 

<sup>33</sup> 

I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have any being. 

<sup>34</sup> 

May my meditation be sweet to Him; as for me, I will rejoice in the Lord. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, O my soul! Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
