<sup>1</sup> 

The Lord is my Shepherd [to feed, guide, and shield me], I shall not lack. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He makes me lie down in [fresh, tender] green pastures; He leads me beside the still and restful waters. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He refreshes and restores my life (my self); He leads me in the paths of righteousness [uprightness and right standing with Him--not for my earning it, but] for His name's sake. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Yes, though I walk through the [deep, sunless] valley of the shadow of death, I will fear or dread no evil, for You are with me; Your rod [to protect] and Your staff [to guide], they comfort me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my [brimming] cup runs over. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Surely or only goodness, mercy, and unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life, and through the length of my days the house of the Lord [and His presence] shall be my dwelling place.
