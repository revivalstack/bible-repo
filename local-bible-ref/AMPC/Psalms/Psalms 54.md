<sup>1</sup> 

Save me, O God, by Your name; judge and vindicate me by Your mighty strength and power. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hear my pleading and my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For strangers and insolent men are rising up against me, and violent men and ruthless ones seek and demand my life; they do not set God before them. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Behold, God is my helper and ally; the Lord is my upholder and is with them who uphold my life. 

<sup>5</sup> 

He will pay back evil to my enemies; in Your faithfulness [Lord] put an end to them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks and praise Your name, O Lord, for it is good. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For He has delivered me out of every trouble, and my eye has looked [in triumph] on my enemies.
