<sup>1</sup> 

When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Judah became [God's] sanctuary (the Holy Place of His habitation), and Israel His dominion. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The [Red] Sea looked and fled; the Jordan [River] was turned back. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs. 

<sup>5</sup> 

What ails you, O [Red] Sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 

<sup>6</sup> 

You mountains, that you skip like rams, and you little hills, like lambs? 

<sup>7</sup> 

Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
