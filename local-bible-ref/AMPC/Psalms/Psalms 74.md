O God, why do You cast us off forever? Why does Your anger burn and smoke against the sheep of Your pasture? 

<sup>2</sup> 

[Earnestly] remember Your congregation which You have acquired of old, which You have redeemed to be the tribe of Your heritage; remember Mount Zion, where You have dwelt. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Direct Your feet [quickly] to the perpetual ruins and desolations; the foe has devastated and desecrated everything in the sanctuary. 

<sup>4</sup> 

In the midst of Your Holy Place Your enemies have roared [with their battle cry]; they set up their own [idol] emblems for signs [of victory]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They seemed like men who lifted up axes upon a thicket of trees to make themselves a record. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And then all the carved wood of the Holy Place they broke down with hatchets and hammers. 

<sup>7</sup> 

They have set Your sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling place of Your Name by casting it to the ground. 

<sup>8</sup> 

They said in their hearts, Let us make havoc [of such places] altogether. They have burned up all God's meetinghouses in the land. 

<sup>9</sup> 

We do not see our symbols; there is no longer any prophet, neither does any among us know for how long. 

<sup>10</sup> 

O God, how long is the adversary to scoff and reproach? Is the enemy to blaspheme and revile Your name forever? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Why do You hold back Your hand, even Your right hand? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them [make an end of them]! 

<sup>12</sup> 

Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You did divide the [Red] Sea by Your might; You broke the heads of the [Egyptian] dragons in the waters. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You crushed the heads of Leviathan (Egypt); You did give him as food for the creatures inhabiting the wilderness. 

<sup>15</sup> 

You did cleave open [the rock bringing forth] fountains and streams; You dried up mighty, ever-flowing rivers (the Jordan). 

<sup>16</sup> 

The day is Yours, the night also is Yours; You have established the [starry] light and the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You have fixed all the borders of the earth [the divisions of land and sea and of the nations]; You have made summer and winter. 

<sup>18</sup> 

[Earnestly] remember how the enemy has scoffed, O Lord, and reproached You, and how a foolish and impious people has blasphemed Your name. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Oh, do not deliver the life of your turtledove to the wild beast (to the greedy multitude); forget not the life [of the multitude] of Your poor forever. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Have regard for the covenant [You made with Abraham], for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Oh, let not the downtrodden return in shame; let the oppressed and needy praise Your name. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Arise, O God, plead Your own cause; remember [earnestly] how the foolish and impious man scoffs and reproaches You day after day and all day long. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Do not forget the [clamoring] voices of Your adversaries, the tumult of those who rise up against You, which ascends continually.
