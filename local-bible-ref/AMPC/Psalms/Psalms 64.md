<sup>1</sup> 

Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; guard and preserve my life from the terror of the enemy. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hide me from the secret counsel and conspiracy of the ungodly, from the scheming of evildoers, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Who whet their tongues like a sword, who aim venomous words like arrows, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who shoot from ambush at the blameless man; suddenly do they shoot at him, without self-reproach or fear. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They encourage themselves in an evil purpose, they talk of laying snares secretly; they say, Who will discover us? 

<sup>6</sup> 

They think out acts of injustice and say, We have accomplished a well-devised thing! For the inward thought of each one [is unsearchable] and his heart is deep. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But God will shoot an unexpected arrow at them; and suddenly shall they be wounded. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And they will be made to stumble, their own tongues turning against them; all who gaze upon them will shake their heads and flee away. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And all men shall [reverently] fear and be in awe; and they will declare the work of God, for they will wisely consider and acknowledge that it is His doing. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The [uncompromisingly] righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust and take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory and offer praise.
