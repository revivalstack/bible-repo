<sup>1</sup> 

By the rivers of Babylon, there we [captives] sat down, yes, we wept when we [earnestly] remembered Zion [the city of our God imprinted on our hearts]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

On the willow trees in the midst of [Babylon] we hung our harps. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For there they who led us captive required of us a song with words, and our tormentors and they who wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 

<sup>4</sup> 

How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? 

<sup>5</sup> 

If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill [with the harp]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I remember you not, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Remember, O Lord, against the Edomites, that they said in the day of Jerusalem's fall, Down, down to the ground with her! 

<sup>8</sup> 

O Daughter of Babylon [you devastator, you!], who [ought to be and] shall be destroyed, happy and blessed shall he be who requites you as you have served us. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Happy and blessed shall he be who takes and dashes your little ones against the rock!
