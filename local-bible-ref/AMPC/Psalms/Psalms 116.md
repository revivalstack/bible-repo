<sup>1</sup> 

I love the Lord, because He has heard [and now hears] my voice and my supplications. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Because He has inclined His ear to me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The cords and sorrows of death were around me, and the terrors of Sheol (the place of the dead) had laid hold of me; I suffered anguish and grief (trouble and sorrow). 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then called I upon the name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech You, save my life and deliver me! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Gracious is the Lord, and [rigidly] righteous; yes, our God is merciful. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He helped and saved me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Return to your rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For You have delivered my life from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling and falling. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. 

<sup>10</sup> 

I believed (trusted in, relied on, and clung to my God), and therefore have I spoken [even when I said], I am greatly afflicted. 

<sup>11</sup> 

I said in my haste, All men are deceitful and liars. 

<sup>12</sup> 

What shall I render to the Lord for all His benefits toward me? [How can I repay Him for all His bountiful dealings?] 

<sup>13</sup> 

I will lift up the cup of salvation and deliverance and call on the name of the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

I will pay my vows to the Lord, yes, in the presence of all His people. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Precious (important and no light matter) in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints (His loving ones). 

<sup>16</sup> 

O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call on the name of the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 

I will pay my vows to the Lord, yes, in the presence of all His people, 

<sup>19</sup> 

In the courts of the Lord's house--in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
