<sup>1</sup> 

Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> 

From the end of the earth will I cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed and fainting; lead me to the rock that is higher than I [yes, a rock that is too high for me]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For You have been a shelter and a refuge for me, a strong tower against the adversary. 

<sup>4</sup> 

I will dwell in Your tabernacle forever; let me find refuge and trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage of those who fear, revere, and honor Your name. 

<sup>6</sup> 

May You prolong the [true] King's life [adding days upon days], and may His years be to the last generation [of this world and the generations of the world to come]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

May He sit enthroned forever before [the face of] God; O ordain that loving-kindness and faithfulness may watch over Him! 

<sup>8</sup> 

So will I sing praise to Your name forever, paying my vows day by day.
