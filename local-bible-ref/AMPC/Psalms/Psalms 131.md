<sup>1</sup> 

Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in matters too great or in things too wonderful for me.

Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me [ceased from fretting]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

O Israel, hope in the Lord from this time forth and forever.
