<sup>1</sup> 

Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness (uprightness, justice, and right standing with You)! You have freed me when I was hemmed in and enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me and hear my prayer. 

<sup>2</sup> 

O you sons of men, how long will you turn my honor and glory into shame? How long will you love vanity and futility and seek after lies? Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself [and given distinction to] him who is godly [the man of loving-kindness]. The Lord listens and heeds when I call to Him. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Be angry [or stand in awe] and sin not; commune with your own hearts upon your beds and be silent (sorry for the things you say in your hearts). Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Offer just and right sacrifices; trust (lean on and be confident) in the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Many say, Oh, that we might see some good! Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You have put more joy and rejoicing in my heart than [they know] when their wheat and new wine have yielded abundantly. 

<sup>8</sup> 

In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You, Lord, alone make me dwell in safety and confident trust.
