<sup>1</sup> 

I will extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

O Lord my God, I cried to You and You have healed me. 

<sup>3</sup> 

O Lord, You have brought my life up from Sheol (the place of the dead); You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit (the grave). 

<sup>4</sup> 

Sing to the Lord, O you saints of His, and give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For His anger is but for a moment, but His favor is for a lifetime or in His favor is life. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning. 

<sup>6</sup> 

As for me, in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 

<sup>7</sup> 

By Your favor, O Lord, You have established me as a strong mountain; You hid Your face, and I was troubled. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I cried to You, O Lord, and to the Lord I made supplication. 

<sup>9</sup> 

What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit (the grave)? Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth and faithfulness to men? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Hear, O Lord, have mercy and be gracious to me! O Lord, be my helper! 

<sup>11</sup> 

You have turned my mourning into dancing for me; You have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness, 

<sup>12</sup> 

To the end that my tongue and my heart and everything glorious within me may sing praise to You and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.
