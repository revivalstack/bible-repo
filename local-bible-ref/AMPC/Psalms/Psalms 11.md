<sup>1</sup> 

In the Lord I take refuge [and put my trust]; how can you say to me, Flee like a bird to your mountain? 

<sup>2</sup> 

For see, the wicked are bending the bow; they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they [furtively] in darkness may shoot at the upright in heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 

If the foundations are destroyed, what can the [unyieldingly] righteous do, or what has He [the Righteous One] wrought or accomplished? 

<sup>4</sup> 

The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold; His eyelids test and prove the children of men. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The Lord tests and proves the [unyieldingly] righteous, but His soul abhors the wicked and him who loves violence. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Upon the wicked He will rain quick burning coals or snares; fire, brimstone, and a [dreadful] scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For the Lord is [rigidly] righteous, He loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold His face, or He beholds the upright.
