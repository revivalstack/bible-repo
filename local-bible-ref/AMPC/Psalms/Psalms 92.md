It is a good and delightful thing to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises [with musical accompaniment] to Your name, O Most High, 

<sup>2</sup> 

To show forth Your loving-kindness in the morning and Your faithfulness by night, 

<sup>3</sup> 

With an instrument of ten strings and with the lute, with a solemn sound upon the lyre. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For You, O Lord, have made me glad by Your works; at the deeds of Your hands I joyfully sing. 

<sup>5</sup> 

How great are Your doings, O Lord! Your thoughts are very deep. 

<sup>6</sup> 

A man in his rude and uncultivated state knows not, neither does a [self-confident] fool understand this: 

<sup>7</sup> 

That though the wicked spring up like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to be destroyed forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But You, Lord, are on high forever. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For behold, Your adversaries, O Lord, for behold, Your enemies shall perish; all the evildoers shall be scattered. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But my horn (emblem of excessive strength and stately grace) You have exalted like that of a wild ox; I am anointed with fresh oil. 

<sup>11</sup> 

My eye looks upon those who lie in wait for me; my ears hear the evildoers that rise up against me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The [uncompromisingly] righteous shall flourish like the palm tree [be long-lived, stately, upright, useful, and fruitful]; they shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon [majestic, stable, durable, and incorruptible]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall flourish in the courts of our God. 

<sup>14</sup> 

[Growing in grace] they shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap [of spiritual vitality] and [rich in the] verdure [of trust, love, and contentment]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[They are living memorials] to show that the Lord is upright and faithful to His promises; He is my Rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
