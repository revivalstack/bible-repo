<sup>1</sup> 

O God of my praise! Keep not silence, 

<sup>2</sup> 

For the mouths of the wicked and the mouth of deceit are opened against me; they have spoken to me and against me with lying tongues. 

<sup>3</sup> 

They have compassed me about also with words of hatred and have fought against me without a cause. 

<sup>4</sup> 

In return for my love they are my adversaries, but I resort to prayer. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And they have rewarded and laid upon me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Set a wicked man over him [as a judge], and let [a malicious] accuser stand at his right hand. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When [the wicked] is judged, let him be condemned, and let his prayer [for leniency] be turned into a sin. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let his days be few; and let another take his office and charge. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Let his children be continual vagabonds [as was Cain] and beg; let them seek their bread and be driven far from their ruined homes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let the creditor and extortioner seize all that he has; and let strangers (barbarians and foreigners) plunder the fruits of his labor. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Let there be none to extend or continue mercy and kindness to him, neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their names be blotted out. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Let them be before the Lord continually, that He may cut off the memory of them from the earth!-- 

<sup>16</sup> 

Because the man did not [earnestly] remember to show mercy, but pursued and persecuted the poor and needy man, and the broken in heart [he was ready] to slay. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Yes, he loved cursing, and it came [back] upon him; he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, and it seeped into his inward [life] like water, and like oil into his bones. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Let it be to him as the raiment with which he covers himself and as the girdle with which he is girded continually. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Let this be the reward of my adversaries from the Lord, and of those who speak evil against my life. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But You deal with me and act for me, O God the Lord, for Your name's sake; because Your mercy and loving-kindness are good, O deliver me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded and stricken within me. 

<sup>23</sup> 

I am gone like the shadow when it lengthens and declines; I toss up and down and am shaken off as the locust. 

<sup>24</sup> 

My knees are weak and totter from fasting; and my body is gaunt and has no fatness. 

<sup>25</sup> 

I have become also a reproach and a taunt to others; when they see me, they shake their heads. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Help me, O Lord my God; O save me according to Your mercy and loving-kindness!-- 

<sup>27</sup> 

That they may know that this is Your hand, that You, Lord, have done it. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Let them curse, but do You bless. When adversaries arise, let them be put to shame, but let Your servant rejoice. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Let my adversaries be clothed with shame and dishonor, and let them cover themselves with their own disgrace and confusion as with a robe. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I will give great praise and thanks to the Lord with my mouth; yes, and I will praise Him among the multitude. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For He will stand at the right hand of the poor and needy, to save him from those who condemn his life.
