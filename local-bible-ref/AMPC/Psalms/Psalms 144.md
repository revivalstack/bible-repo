<sup>1</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord, my Rock and my keen and firm Strength, Who teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight-- 

<sup>2</sup> 

My Steadfast Love and my Fortress, my High Tower and my Deliverer, my Shield and He in Whom I trust and take refuge, Who subdues my people under me. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Lord, what is man that You take notice of him? Or [the] son of man that You take account of him? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Man is like vanity and a breath; his days are as a shadow that passes away. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Bow Your heavens, O Lord, and come down; touch the mountains, and they shall smoke. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Cast forth lightning and scatter [my enemies]; send out Your arrows and embarrass and frustrate them. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Stretch forth Your hand from above; rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, from the hands of hostile aliens (tribes around us) 

<sup>8</sup> 

Whose mouths speak deceit and whose right hands are right hands [raised in taking] fraudulent oaths. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I will sing a new song to You, O God; upon a harp, an instrument of ten strings, will I offer praises to You. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You are He Who gives salvation to kings, Who rescues David His servant from the hurtful sword [of evil]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Rescue me and deliver me out of the power of [hostile] alien [tribes] whose mouths speak deceit and whose right hands are right hands [raised in taking] fraudulent oaths. 

<sup>12</sup> 

When our sons shall be as plants grown large in their youth and our daughters as sculptured corner pillars hewn like those of a palace; 

<sup>13</sup> 

When our garners are full, affording all manner of store, and our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our pastures; 

<sup>14</sup> 

When our oxen are well loaded; when there is no invasion [of hostile armies] and no going forth [against besiegers--when there is no murder or manslaughter] and no outcry in our streets; 

<sup>15</sup> 

Happy and blessed are the people who are in such a case; yes, happy (blessed, fortunate, prosperous, to be envied) are the people whose God is the Lord!
