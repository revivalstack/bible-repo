<sup>1</sup> 

How long will You forget me, O Lord? Forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 

<sup>2</sup> 

How long must I lay up cares within me and have sorrow in my heart day after day? How long shall my enemy exalt himself over me? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; lighten the eyes [of my faith to behold Your face in the pitchlike darkness], lest I sleep the sleep of death, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Lest my enemy say, I have prevailed over him, and those that trouble me rejoice when I am shaken. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But I have trusted, leaned on, and been confident in Your mercy and loving-kindness; my heart shall rejoice and be in high spirits in Your salvation. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I will sing to the Lord, because He has dealt bountifully with me.
