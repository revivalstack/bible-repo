<sup>1</sup> 

Transgression [like an oracle] speaks to the wicked deep in his heart. There is no fear or dread of God before his eyes. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For he flatters and deceives himself in his own eyes that his iniquity will not be found out and be hated. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The words of his mouth are wrong and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He plans wrongdoing on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject or despise evil. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, extend to the skies, and Your faithfulness to the clouds. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Your righteousness is like the mountains of God, Your judgments are like the great deep. O Lord, You preserve man and beast. 

<sup>7</sup> 

How precious is Your steadfast love, O God! The children of men take refuge and put their trust under the shadow of Your wings. 

<sup>8</sup> 

They relish and feast on the abundance of Your house; and You cause them to drink of the stream of Your pleasures. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light do we see light. 

<sup>10</sup> 

O continue Your loving-kindness to those who know You, Your righteousness (salvation) to the upright in heart. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

<sup>12</sup> 

There the workers of iniquity fall and lie prostrate; they are thrust down and shall not be able to rise.
