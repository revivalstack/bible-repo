<sup>1</sup> 

Praise the Lord! For it is good to sing praises to our God, for He is gracious and lovely; praise is becoming and appropriate. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord is building up Jerusalem; He is gathering together the exiles of Israel. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds [curing their pains and their sorrows]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He determines and counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by their names. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Great is our Lord and of great power; His understanding is inexhaustible and boundless. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The Lord lifts up the humble and downtrodden; He casts the wicked down to the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving; sing praises with the harp or the lyre to our God!-- 

<sup>8</sup> 

Who covers the heavens with clouds, Who prepares rain for the earth, Who makes grass to grow on the mountains. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He gives to the beast his food, and to the young ravens that for which they cry. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He delights not in the strength of the horse, nor does He take pleasure in the legs of a man. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Lord takes pleasure in those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him, in those who hope in His mercy and loving-kindness. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion! 

<sup>13</sup> 

For He has strengthened and made hard the bars of your gates, and He has blessed your children within you. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He makes peace in your borders; He fills you with the finest of the wheat. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He sends forth His commandment to the earth; His word runs very swiftly. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He gives [to the earth] snow like [a blanket of] wool; He scatters the hoarfrost like ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He casts forth His ice like crumbs; who can stand before His cold? 

<sup>18</sup> 

He sends out His word, and melts [ice and snow]; He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances to Israel. 

<sup>20</sup> 

He has not dealt so with any [other] nation; they have not known (understood, appreciated, given heed to, and cherished) His ordinances. Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
