<sup>1</sup> 

Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck [they threaten my life]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, where the floods overwhelm me. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched; my eyes fail with waiting [hopefully] for my God. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Those who hate me without cause are more than the hairs of my head; those who would cut me off and destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are many and mighty. I am [forced] to restore what I did not steal. 

<sup>5</sup> 

O God, You know my folly and blundering; my sins and my guilt are not hidden from You. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Let not those who wait and hope and look for You, O Lord of hosts, be put to shame through me; let not those who seek and inquire for and require You [as their vital necessity] be brought to confusion and dishonor through me, O God of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Because for Your sake I have borne taunt and reproach; confusion and shame have covered my face. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I have become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to my mother's children. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For zeal for Your house has eaten me up, and the reproaches and insults of those who reproach and insult You have fallen upon me. 

<sup>10</sup> 

When I wept and humbled myself with fasting, I was jeered at and humiliated; 

<sup>11</sup> 

When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword (an object of scorn) to them. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They who sit in [the city's] gate talk about me, and I am the song of the drunkards. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But as for me, my prayer is to You, O Lord. At an acceptable and opportune time, O God, in the multitude of Your mercy and the abundance of Your loving-kindness hear me, and in the truth and faithfulness of Your salvation answer me. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Rescue me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from those who hate me and from out of the deep waters. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Let not the floodwaters overflow and overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up nor the [dug] pit [with water perhaps in the bottom] close its mouth over me. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Hear and answer me, O Lord, for Your loving-kindness is sweet and comforting; according to Your plenteous tender mercy and steadfast love turn to me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Hide not Your face from Your servant, for I am in distress; O answer me speedily! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Draw close to me and redeem me; ransom and set me free because of my enemies [lest they glory in my prolonged distress]! 

<sup>19</sup> 

You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor; my adversaries are all before You [fully known to You]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Insults and reproach have broken my heart; I am full of heaviness and I am distressingly sick. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none. 

<sup>21</sup> 

They gave me also gall [poisonous and bitter] for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar (a soured wine) to drink. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Let their own table [with all its abundance and luxury] become a snare to them; and when they are secure in peace [or at their sacrificial feasts, let it become] a trap to them. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually [from terror, dismay, and feebleness]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Pour out Your indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Your burning anger catch up with them. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Let their habitation and their encampment be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For they pursue and persecute him whom You have smitten, and they gossip about those whom You have wounded, [adding] to their grief and pain. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Let one [unforgiven] perverseness and iniquity accumulate upon another for them [in Your book], and let them not come into Your righteousness or be justified and acquitted by You. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and the book of life and not be enrolled among the [uncompromisingly] righteous (those upright and in right standing with God). 

<sup>29</sup> 

But I am poor, sorrowful, and in pain; let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify Him with thanksgiving, 

<sup>31</sup> 

And it will please the Lord better than an ox or a bullock that has horns and hoofs. 

<sup>32</sup> 

The humble shall see it and be glad; you who seek God, inquiring for and requiring Him [as your first need], let your hearts revive and live! 

<sup>33</sup> 

For the Lord hears the poor and needy and despises not His prisoners (His miserable and wounded ones). 

<sup>34</sup> 

Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas and everything that moves in them. 

<sup>35</sup> 

For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah; and [His servants] shall remain and dwell there and have it in their possession; 

<sup>36</sup> 

The children of His servants shall inherit it, and those who love His name shall dwell in it.
