My heart overflows with a goodly theme; I address my psalm to a King. My tongue is like the pen of a ready writer. 

<sup>2</sup> 

You are fairer than the children of men; graciousness is poured upon Your lips; therefore God has blessed You forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O mighty One, in Your glory and Your majesty! 

<sup>4</sup> 

And in Your majesty ride on triumphantly for the cause of truth, humility, and righteousness (uprightness and right standing with God); and let Your right hand guide You to tremendous things. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your arrows are sharp; the peoples fall under You; Your darts pierce the hearts of the King's enemies. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You love righteousness, uprightness, and right standing with God and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Your garments are all fragrant with myrrh, aloes, and cassia; stringed instruments make You glad. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Kings' daughters are among Your honorable women; at Your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Hear, O daughter, consider, submit, and consent to my instruction: forget also your own people and your father's house; 

<sup>11</sup> 

So will the King desire your beauty; because He is your Lord, be submissive and reverence and honor Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And, O daughter of Tyre, the richest of the people shall entreat your favor with a gift. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The King's daughter in the inner part [of the palace] is all glorious; her clothing is inwrought with gold. 

<sup>14</sup> 

She shall be brought to the King in raiment of needlework; with the virgins, her companions that follow her, she shall be brought to You. 

<sup>15</sup> 

With gladness and rejoicing will they be brought; they will enter into the King's palace. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons, whom You will make princes in all the land. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise and give You thanks forever and ever.
