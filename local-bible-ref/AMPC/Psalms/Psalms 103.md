<sup>1</sup> 

Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, O my soul; and all that is [deepest] within me, bless His holy name! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, O my soul, and forget not [one of] all His benefits-- 

<sup>3</sup> 

Who forgives [every one of] all your iniquities, Who heals [each one of] all your diseases, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who redeems your life from the pit and corruption, Who beautifies, dignifies, and crowns you with loving-kindness and tender mercy; 

<sup>5</sup> 

Who satisfies your mouth [your necessity and desire at your personal age and situation] with good so that your youth, renewed, is like the eagle's [strong, overcoming, soaring]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

The Lord executes righteousness and justice [not for me only, but] for all who are oppressed. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He made known His ways [of righteousness and justice] to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and plenteous in mercy and loving-kindness. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He will not always chide or be contending, neither will He keep His anger forever or hold a grudge. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great are His mercy and loving-kindness toward those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. 

<sup>13</sup> 

As a father loves and pities his children, so the Lord loves and pities those who fear Him [with reverence, worship, and awe]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For He knows our frame, He [earnestly] remembers and imprints [on His heart] that we are dust. 

<sup>15</sup> 

As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so he flourishes. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For the wind passes over it and it is gone, and its place shall know it no more. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But the mercy and loving-kindness of the Lord are from everlasting to everlasting upon those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him, and His righteousness is to children's children-- 

<sup>18</sup> 

To such as keep His covenant [hearing, receiving, loving, and obeying it] and to those who [earnestly] remember His commandments to do them [imprinting them on their hearts]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, you His angels, you mighty ones who do His commandments, hearkening to the voice of His word. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, all you His hosts, you His ministers who do His pleasure. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Bless the Lord, all His works in all places of His dominion; bless (affectionately, gratefully praise) the Lord, O my soul!
