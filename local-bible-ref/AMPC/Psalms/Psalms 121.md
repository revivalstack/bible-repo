<sup>1</sup> 

I will lift up my eyes to the hills [around Jerusalem, to sacred Mount Zion and Mount Moriah]--From whence shall my help come? 

<sup>2</sup> 

My help comes from the Lord, Who made heaven and earth. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He will not allow your foot to slip or to be moved; He Who keeps you will not slumber. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The Lord is your keeper; the Lord is your shade on your right hand [the side not carrying a shield]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The Lord will keep you from all evil; He will keep your life. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore.
