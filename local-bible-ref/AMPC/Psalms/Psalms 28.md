<sup>1</sup> 

Unto You do I cry, O Lord my Rock, be not deaf and silent to me, lest, if You be silent to me, I become like those going down to the pit [the grave]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hear the voice of my supplication as I cry to You for help, as I lift up my hands toward Your innermost sanctuary (the Holy of Holies). 

<sup>3</sup> 

Drag me not away with the wicked, with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbors, but malice and mischief are in their hearts. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Repay them according to their work and according to the wickedness of their doings; repay them according to the work of their hands; render to them what they deserve. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Because they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operations of His hands, He will break them down and not rebuild them. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord, because He has heard the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The Lord is my Strength and my [impenetrable] Shield; my heart trusts in, relies on, and confidently leans on Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise Him. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The Lord is their [unyielding] Strength, and He is the Stronghold of salvation to [me] His anointed. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Save Your people and bless Your heritage; nourish and shepherd them and carry them forever.
