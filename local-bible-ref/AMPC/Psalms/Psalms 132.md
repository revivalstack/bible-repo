Lord, [earnestly] remember to David's credit all his humiliations and hardships and endurance-- 

<sup>2</sup> 

How he swore to the Lord and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob: 

<sup>3</sup> 

Surely I will not enter my dwelling house or get into my bed-- 

<sup>4</sup> 

I will not permit my eyes to sleep or my eyelids to slumber, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Until I have found a place for the Lord, a habitation for the Mighty One of Jacob. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Behold, at Ephratah we [first] heard of [the discovered ark]; we found it in the fields of the wood [at Kiriath-jearim]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let us go into His tabernacle; let us worship at His footstool. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Arise, O Lord, to Your resting-place, You and the ark [the symbol] of Your strength. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness (right living and right standing with God); and let Your saints shout for joy! 

<sup>10</sup> 

For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the face of Your anointed and reject not Your own king. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Lord swore to David in truth; He will not turn back from it: One of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne. 

<sup>12</sup> 

If your children will keep My covenant and My testimony that I shall teach them, their children also shall sit upon your throne forever. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For the Lord has chosen Zion, He has desired it for His habitation: 

<sup>14</sup> 

This is My resting-place forever [says the Lord]; here will I dwell, for I have desired it. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I will surely and abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Her priests also will I clothe with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 

<sup>17</sup> 

There will I make a horn spring forth and bud for David; I have ordained and prepared a lamp for My anointed [fulfilling the promises of old]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
