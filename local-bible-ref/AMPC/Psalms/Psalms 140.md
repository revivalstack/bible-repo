<sup>1</sup> 

Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men; preserve me from violent men; 

<sup>2</sup> 

They devise mischiefs in their heart; continually they gather together and stir up wars. 

<sup>3</sup> 

They sharpen their tongues like a serpent's; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent men who have purposed to thrust aside my steps. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The proud have hidden a snare for me; they have spread cords as a net by the wayside, they have set traps for me. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>6</sup> 

I said to the Lord, You are my God; give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

O God the Lord, the Strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not their wicked plot and device, lest they exalt themselves. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Those who are fencing me in raise their heads; may the mischief of their own lips and the very things they desire for me come upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into floods of water or deep water pits, from which they shall not rise. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let not a man of slanderous tongue be established in the earth; let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him [let calamity follow his evildoings]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I know and rest in confidence upon it that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will secure justice for the poor and needy [of His believing children]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Surely the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall give thanks to Your name; the upright shall dwell in Your presence (before Your very face).
