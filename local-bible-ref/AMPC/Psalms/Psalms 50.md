<sup>1</sup> 

The Mighty One, God, the Lord, speaks and calls the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Our God comes and does not keep silence; a fire devours before Him, and round about Him a mighty tempest rages. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He may judge His people: 

<sup>5</sup> 

Gather together to Me My saints [those who have found grace in My sight], those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the heavens declare His righteousness (rightness and justice), for God, He is judge. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify to you and against you: I am God, your God. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I do not reprove you for your sacrifices; your burnt offerings are continually before Me. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I will accept no bull from your house nor he-goat out of your folds. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills or upon the mountains where thousands are. 

<sup>11</sup> 

I know and am acquainted with all the birds of the mountains, and the wild animals of the field are Mine and are with Me, in My mind. 

<sup>12</sup> 

If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are Mine. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Shall I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 

<sup>14</sup> 

Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And call on Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall honor and glorify Me. 

<sup>16</sup> 

But to the wicked, God says: What right have you to recite My statutes or take My covenant or pledge on your lips, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Seeing that you hate instruction and correction and cast My words behind you [discarding them]? 

<sup>18</sup> 

When you see a thief, you associate with him, and you have taken part with adulterers. 

<sup>19</sup> 

You give your mouth to evil, and your tongue frames deceit. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son. 

<sup>21</sup> 

These things you have done and I kept silent; you thought I was once entirely like you. But [now] I will reprove you and put [the charge] in order before your eyes. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He who brings an offering of praise and thanksgiving honors and glorifies Me; and he who orders his way aright [who prepares the way that I may show him], to him I will demonstrate the salvation of God.
