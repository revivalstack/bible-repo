O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let Israel now say that His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Let the house of Aaron [the priesthood] now say that His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Let those now who reverently and worshipfully fear the Lord say that His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Out of my distress I called upon the Lord; the Lord answered me and set me free and in a large place. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? 

<sup>7</sup> 

The Lord is on my side and takes my part, He is among those who help me; therefore shall I see my desire established upon those who hate me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

It is better to trust and take refuge in the Lord than to put confidence in man. 

<sup>9</sup> 

It is better to trust and take refuge in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. 

<sup>10</sup> 

All nations (the surrounding tribes) compassed me about, but in the name of the Lord I will cut them off! 

<sup>11</sup> 

They compassed me about, yes, they surrounded me on every side; but in the name of the Lord I will cut them off! 

<sup>12</sup> 

They swarmed about me like bees, they blaze up and are extinguished like a fire of thorns; in the name of the Lord I will cut them off! 

<sup>13</sup> 

You [my adversary] thrust sorely at me that I might fall, but the Lord helped me. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The Lord is my Strength and Song; and He has become my Salvation. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents and private dwellings of the [uncompromisingly] righteous: the right hand of the Lord does valiantly and achieves strength! 

<sup>16</sup> 

The right hand of the Lord is exalted; the right hand of the Lord does valiantly and achieves strength! 

<sup>17</sup> 

I shall not die but live, and shall declare the works and recount the illustrious acts of the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The Lord has chastened me sorely, but He has not given me over to death. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Open to me the [temple] gates of righteousness; I will enter through them, and I will confess and praise the Lord. 

<sup>20</sup> 

This is the gate of the Lord; the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall enter through it. 

<sup>21</sup> 

I will confess, praise, and give thanks to You, for You have heard and answered me; and You have become my Salvation and Deliverer. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. 

<sup>23</sup> 

This is from the Lord and is His doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. 

<sup>24</sup> 

This is the day which the Lord has brought about; we will rejoice and be glad in it. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Save now, we beseech You, O Lord; send now prosperity, O Lord, we beseech You, and give to us success! 

<sup>26</sup> 

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; we bless you from the house of the Lord [you who come into His sanctuary under His guardianship]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

The Lord is God, Who has shown and given us light [He has illuminated us with grace, freedom, and joy]. Decorate the festival with leafy boughs and bind the sacrifices to be offered with thick cords [all over the priest's court, right up] to the horns of the altar. 

<sup>28</sup> 

You are my God, and I will confess, praise, and give thanks to You; You are my God, I will extol You. 

<sup>29</sup> 

O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever.
