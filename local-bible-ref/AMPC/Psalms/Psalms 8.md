O Lord, our Lord, how excellent (majestic and glorious) is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory on [or above] the heavens. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Out of the mouths of babes and unweaned infants You have established strength because of Your foes, that You might silence the enemy and the avenger. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When I view and consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained and established, 

<sup>4</sup> 

What is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of [earthborn] man that You care for him? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Yet You have made him but a little lower than God [or heavenly beings], and You have crowned him with glory and honor. 

<sup>6</sup> 

You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet: 

<sup>7</sup> 

All sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field, 

<sup>8</sup> 

The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes along the paths of the seas. 

<sup>9</sup> 

O Lord, our Lord, how excellent (majestic and glorious) is Your name in all the earth!
