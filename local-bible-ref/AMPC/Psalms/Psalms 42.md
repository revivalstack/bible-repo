<sup>1</sup> 

As the hart pants and longs for the water brooks, so I pant and long for You, O God. 

<sup>2</sup> 

My inner self thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and behold the face of God? 

<sup>3</sup> 

My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, Where is your God? 

<sup>4</sup> 

These things I [earnestly] remember and pour myself out within me: how I went slowly before the throng and led them in procession to the house of God [like a bandmaster before his band, timing the steps to the sound of music and the chant of song], with the voice of shouting and praise, a throng keeping festival. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me and be disquieted within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, my Help and my God. 

<sup>6</sup> 

O my God, my life is cast down upon me [and I find the burden more than I can bear]; therefore will I [earnestly] remember You from the land of the Jordan [River] and the [summits of Mount] Hermon, from the little mountain Mizar. 

<sup>7</sup> 

[Roaring] deep calls to [roaring] deep at the thunder of Your waterspouts; all Your breakers and Your rolling waves have gone over me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Yet the Lord will command His loving-kindness in the daytime, and in the night His song shall be with me, a prayer to the God of my life. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I will say to God my Rock, Why have You forgotten me? Why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 

<sup>10</sup> 

As with a sword [crushing] in my bones, my enemies taunt and reproach me, while they say continually to me, Where is your God? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Why are you cast down, O my inner self? And why should you moan over me and be disquieted within me? Hope in God and wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him, Who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
