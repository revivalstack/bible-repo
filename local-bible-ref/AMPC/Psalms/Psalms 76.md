In Judah God is known and renowned; His name is highly praised and is great in Israel. 

<sup>2</sup>

<sup>3</sup> 

There He broke the bow's flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Glorious and excellent are You from the mountains of prey [splendid and majestic, more than the everlasting mountains]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The stouthearted are stripped of their spoil, they have slept the sleep [of death]; and none of the men of might could raise their hands. 

<sup>6</sup> 

At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both chariot [rider] and horse are cast into a dead sleep [of death]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You, even You, are to be feared [with awe and reverence]! Who may stand in Your presence when once Your anger is roused? 

<sup>8</sup> 

You caused sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was still-- 

<sup>9</sup>

<sup>10</sup> 

Surely the wrath of man shall praise You; the remainder of wrath shall You restrain and gird and arm Yourself with it. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Vow and pay to the Lord your God; let all who are round about Him bring presents to Him Who ought to be [reverently] feared. 

<sup>12</sup>
