Do you indeed in silence speak righteousness, O you mighty ones? [Or is the righteousness, rightness, and justice you should speak quite dumb?] Do you judge fairly and uprightly, O you sons of men? 

<sup>2</sup> 

No, in your heart you devise wickedness; you deal out in the land the violence of your hands. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The ungodly are perverse and estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Their poison is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder or asp that stops its ear, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Which listens not to the voice of charmers or of the enchanter never casting spells so cunningly. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let them melt away as water which runs on apace; when he aims his arrows, let them be as if they were headless or split apart. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let them be as a snail dissolving slime as it passes on or as a festering sore which wastes away, like [the child to which] a woman gives untimely birth that has not seen the sun. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Before your pots can feel the thorns [that are placed under them for fuel], He will take them away as with a whirlwind, the green and the burning ones alike. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The [unyieldingly] righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Men will say, Surely there is a reward for the [uncompromisingly] righteous; surely there is a God Who judges on the earth.
