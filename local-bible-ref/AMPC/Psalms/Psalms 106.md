<sup>1</sup> 

Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!) O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Who can put into words and tell the mighty deeds of the Lord? Or who can show forth all the praise [that is due Him]? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) are those who observe justice [treating others fairly] and who do right and are in right standing with God at all times. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[Earnestly] remember me, O Lord, when You favor Your people! O visit me also when You deliver them, and grant me Your salvation!-- 

<sup>5</sup> 

That I may see and share the welfare of Your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your heritage. 

<sup>6</sup> 

We have sinned, as did also our fathers; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Our fathers in Egypt understood not nor appreciated Your miracles; they did not [earnestly] remember the multitude of Your mercies nor imprint Your loving-kindness [on their hearts], but they were rebellious and provoked the Lord at the sea, even at the Red Sea. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake [to prove the righteousness of the divine character], that He might make His mighty power known. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up; so He led them through the depths as through a pastureland. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And He saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the [Egyptian] enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then [Israel] believed His words [trusting in, relying on them]; they sang His praise. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But they hastily forgot His works; they did not [earnestly] wait for His plans [to develop] regarding them, 

<sup>14</sup> 

But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted and tried to restrain God [with their insistent desires] in the desert. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their souls and [thinned their numbers by] disease and death. 

<sup>16</sup> 

They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron [the high priest], the holy one of the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Therefore the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and closed over the company of Abiram. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And a fire broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 

<sup>19</sup> 

They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Thus they exchanged Him Who was their Glory for the image of an ox that eats grass [they traded their Honor for the image of a calf]! 

<sup>21</sup> 

They forgot God their Savior, Who had done such great things in Egypt, 

<sup>22</sup> 

Wonders and miracles in the land of Ham, dreadful and awesome things at the Red Sea. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Therefore He said He would destroy them. [And He would have done so] had not Moses, His chosen one, stepped into the breach before Him to turn away His threatening wrath. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then they spurned and despised the pleasant and desirable land [Canaan]; they believed not His word [neither trusting in, relying on, nor holding to it]; 

<sup>25</sup> 

But they murmured in their tents and hearkened not to the voice of the Lord. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Therefore He lifted up His hand [as if taking an oath] against them, that He would cause them to fall in the wilderness, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Cast out their descendants among the nations, and scatter them in the lands [of the earth]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

They joined themselves also to the [idol] Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices [offered] to the lifeless [gods]. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Thus they provoked the Lord to anger with their practices, and a plague broke out among them. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Then stood up Phinehas [the priest] and executed judgment, and so the plague was stayed. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And that was credited to him for righteousness (right doing and right standing with God) to all generations forever. 

<sup>32</sup> 

They angered the Lord also at the waters of Meribah, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes; 

<sup>33</sup> 

For they provoked [Moses'] spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips. 

<sup>34</sup> 

They did not destroy the [heathen] nations as the Lord commanded them, 

<sup>35</sup> 

But mingled themselves with the [idolatrous] nations and learned their ways and works 

<sup>36</sup> 

And served their idols, which were a snare to them. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons 

<sup>38</sup> 

And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with their blood. 

<sup>39</sup> 

Thus were they defiled by their own works, and they played the harlot and practiced idolatry with their own deeds [of idolatrous rites]. 

<sup>40</sup> 

Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His people, insomuch that He abhorred and rejected His own heritage. 

<sup>41</sup> 

And He gave them into the hands of the [heathen] nations, and they that hated them ruled over them. 

<sup>42</sup> 

Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under the hand of their foes. 

<sup>43</sup> 

Many times did [God] deliver them, but they were rebellious in their counsel and sank low through their iniquity. 

<sup>44</sup> 

Nevertheless He regarded their distress when He heard their cry; 

<sup>45</sup> 

And He [earnestly] remembered for their sake His covenant and relented their sentence of evil [comforting and easing Himself] according to the abundance of His mercy and loving-kindness [when they cried out to Him]. 

<sup>46</sup> 

He also caused [Israel] to find sympathy among those who had carried them away captive. 

<sup>47</sup> 

Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to Your holy name and glory in praising You. 

<sup>48</sup> 

Blessed (affectionately and gratefully praised) be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
