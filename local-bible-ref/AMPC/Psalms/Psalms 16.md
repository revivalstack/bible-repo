<sup>1</sup> 

Keep and protect me, O God, for in You I have found refuge, and in You do I put my trust and hide myself. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I say to the Lord, You are my Lord; I have no good beside or beyond You. 

<sup>3</sup> 

As for the godly (the saints) who are in the land, they are the excellent, the noble, and the glorious, in whom is all my delight. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Their sorrows shall be multiplied who choose another god; their drink offerings of blood will I not offer or take their names upon my lips. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The Lord is my chosen and assigned portion, my cup; You hold and maintain my lot. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; yes, I have a good heritage. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I will bless the Lord, Who has given me counsel; yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I have set the Lord continually before me; because He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Therefore my heart is glad and my glory [my inner self] rejoices; my body too shall rest and confidently dwell in safety, 

<sup>10</sup> 

For You will not abandon me to Sheol (the place of the dead), neither will You suffer Your holy one [Holy One] to see corruption. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy, at Your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
