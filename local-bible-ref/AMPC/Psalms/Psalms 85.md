<sup>1</sup> 

Lord, You have [at last] been favorable and have dealt graciously with Your land [of Canaan]; You have brought back [from Babylon] the captives of Jacob. 

<sup>2</sup> 

You have forgiven and taken away the iniquity of Your people, You have covered all their sin. Selah [pause, and calmly realize what that means]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

You have withdrawn all Your wrath and indignation, You have turned away from the blazing anger [which You had let loose]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Restore us, O God of our salvation, and cause Your anger toward us to cease [forever]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Will You be angry with us forever? Will You prolong Your anger [and disfavor] and spread it out to all generations? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You? 

<sup>7</sup> 

Show us Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, and grant us Your salvation. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I will listen [with expectancy] to what God the Lord will say, for He will speak peace to His people, to His saints (those who are in right standing with Him)--but let them not turn again to [self-confident] folly. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Surely His salvation is near to those who reverently and worshipfully fear Him, [and is ready to be appropriated] that [the manifest presence of God, His] glory may tabernacle and abide in our land. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Mercy and loving-kindness and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Truth shall spring up from the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Yes, the Lord will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Righteousness shall go before Him and shall make His footsteps a way in which to walk.
