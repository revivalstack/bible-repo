<sup>1</sup> 

Unto You, O Lord, do I bring my life. 

<sup>2</sup> 

O my God, I trust, lean on, rely on, and am confident in You. Let me not be put to shame or [my hope in You] be disappointed; let not my enemies triumph over me. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Yes, let none who trust and wait hopefully and look for You be put to shame or be disappointed; let them be ashamed who forsake the right or deal treacherously without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Show me Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Guide me in Your truth and faithfulness and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You [You only and altogether] do I wait [expectantly] all the day long. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Remember, O Lord, Your tender mercy and loving-kindness; for they have been ever from of old. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Remember not the sins (the lapses and frailties) of my youth or my transgressions; according to Your mercy and steadfast love remember me, for Your goodness' sake, O Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will He instruct sinners in [His] way. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He leads the humble in what is right, and the humble He teaches His way. 

<sup>10</sup> 

All the paths of the Lord are mercy and steadfast love, even truth and faithfulness are they for those who keep His covenant and His testimonies. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For Your name's sake, O Lord, pardon my iniquity and my guilt, for [they are] great. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Who is the man who reverently fears and worships the Lord? Him shall He teach in the way that he should choose. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He himself shall dwell at ease, and his offspring shall inherit the land. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The secret [of the sweet, satisfying companionship] of the Lord have they who fear (revere and worship) Him, and He will show them His covenant and reveal to them its [deep, inner] meaning. 

<sup>15</sup> 

My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for He will pluck my feet out of the net. 

<sup>16</sup> 

[Lord] turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The troubles of my heart are multiplied; bring me out of my distresses. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Behold my affliction and my pain and forgive all my sins [of thinking and doing]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Consider my enemies, for they abound; they hate me with cruel hatred. 

<sup>20</sup> 

O keep me, Lord, and deliver me; let me not be ashamed or disappointed, for my trust and my refuge are in You. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for and expect You. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Redeem Israel, O God, out of all their troubles.
