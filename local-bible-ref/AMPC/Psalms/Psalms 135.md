<sup>1</sup> 

Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!) Praise the name of the Lord; praise Him, O you servants of the Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 

You who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Praise the Lord! For the Lord is good; sing praises to His name, for He is gracious and lovely! 

<sup>4</sup> 

For the Lord has chosen [the descendants of] Jacob for Himself, Israel for His peculiar possession and treasure. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Whatever the Lord pleases, that has He done in the heavens and on earth, in the seas and all deeps-- 

<sup>7</sup> 

Who causes the vapors to arise from the ends of the earth, Who makes lightnings for the rain, Who brings the wind out of His storehouses; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh and all his servants; 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who smote nations many and great and slew mighty kings-- 

<sup>11</sup> 

Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. 

<sup>12</sup> 

[The Lord] gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to Israel His people. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Your name, O Lord, endures forever, Your fame, O Lord, throughout all ages. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For the Lord will judge and vindicate His people, and He will delay His judgments [manifesting His righteousness and mercy] and take into favor His servants [those who meet His terms of separation unto Him]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 

<sup>16</sup> 

[Idols] have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 

<sup>17</sup> 

They have ears, but they hear not, nor is there any breath in their mouths. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Those who make [idols] are like them; so is everyone who trusts in and relies on them. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Bless (affectionately and gratefully praise) the Lord, O house of Israel; bless the Lord, O house of Aaron [God's ministers]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Bless the Lord, O house of Levi [the dedicated tribe]; you who reverently and worshipfully fear the Lord, bless the Lord [affectionately and gratefully praise Him]! 

<sup>21</sup> 

Blessed out of Zion be the Lord, Who dwells [with us] at Jerusalem! Praise the Lord! (Hallelujah!)
