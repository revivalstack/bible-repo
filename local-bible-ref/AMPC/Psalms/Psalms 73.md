Truly God is [only] good to Israel, even to those who are upright and pure in heart. 

<sup>2</sup> 

But as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had well-nigh slipped. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For I was envious of the foolish and arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For they suffer no violent pangs in their death, but their strength is firm. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they smitten and plagued like other men. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Therefore pride is about their necks like a chain; violence covers them like a garment [like a long, luxurious robe]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Their eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart could wish; and the imaginations of their minds overflow [with follies]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

They scoff, and wickedly utter oppression; they speak loftily [from on high, maliciously and blasphemously]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

They set their mouths against and speak down from heaven, and their tongues swagger through the earth [invading even heaven with blasphemy and smearing earth with slanders]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Therefore His people return here, and waters of a full cup [offered by the wicked] are [blindly] drained by them. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And they say, How does God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Behold, these are the ungodly, who always prosper and are at ease in the world; they increase in riches. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Surely then in vain have I cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For all the day long have I been smitten and plagued, and chastened every morning. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Had I spoken thus [and given expression to my feelings], I would have been untrue and have dealt treacherously against the generation of Your children. 

<sup>16</sup> 

But when I considered how to understand this, it was too great an effort for me and too painful 

<sup>17</sup> 

Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I understood [for I considered] their end. 

<sup>18</sup> 

[After all] You do set the [wicked] in slippery places; You cast them down to ruin and destruction. 

<sup>19</sup> 

How they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors! 

<sup>20</sup> 

As a dream [which seems real] until one awakens, so, O Lord, when You arouse Yourself [to take note of the wicked], You will despise their outward show. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For my heart was grieved, embittered, and in a state of ferment, and I was pricked in my heart [as with the sharp fang of an adder]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

So foolish, stupid, and brutish was I, and ignorant; I was like a beast before You. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Nevertheless I am continually with You; You do hold my right hand. 

<sup>24</sup> 

You will guide me with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to honor and glory. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Whom have I in heaven but You? And I have no delight or desire on earth besides You. 

<sup>26</sup> 

My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the Rock and firm Strength of my heart and my Portion forever. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For behold, those who are far from You shall perish; You will destroy all who are false to You and like [spiritual] harlots depart from You. 

<sup>28</sup> 

But it is good for me to draw near to God; I have put my trust in the Lord God and made Him my refuge, that I may tell of all Your works.
