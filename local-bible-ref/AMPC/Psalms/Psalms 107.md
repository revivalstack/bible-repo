<sup>1</sup> 

O give thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has delivered from the hand of the adversary, 

<sup>3</sup> 

And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the [Red] Sea in the south. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Some wandered in the wilderness in a solitary desert track; they found no city for habitation. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Hungry and thirsty, they fainted; their lives were near to being extinguished. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He led them forth by the straight and right way, that they might go to a city where they could establish their homes. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Oh, that men would praise [and confess to] the Lord for His goodness and loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>9</sup> 

For He satisfies the longing soul and fills the hungry soul with good. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and in irons, 

<sup>11</sup> 

Because they had rebelled against the words of God and spurned the counsel of the Most High. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Therefore He bowed down their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled and fell down, and there was none to help. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and He saved them out of their distresses. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke apart the bonds that held them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Oh, that men would praise [and confess to] the Lord for His goodness and loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>16</sup> 

For He has broken the gates of bronze and cut the bars of iron apart. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Some are fools [made ill] because of the way of their transgressions and are afflicted because of their iniquities. 

<sup>18</sup> 

They loathe every kind of food, and they draw near to the gates of death. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He delivers them out of their distresses. 

<sup>20</sup> 

He sends forth His word and heals them and rescues them from the pit and destruction. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Oh, that men would praise [and confess to] the Lord for His goodness and loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>22</sup> 

And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and rehearse His deeds with shouts of joy and singing! 

<sup>23</sup> 

Some go down to the sea and travel over it in ships to do business in great waters; 

<sup>24</sup> 

These see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the deep. 

<sup>25</sup> 

For He commands and raises up the stormy wind, which lifts up the waves of the sea. 

<sup>26</sup> 

[Those aboard] mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the deeps; their courage melts away because of their plight. 

<sup>27</sup> 

They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits' end [all their wisdom has come to nothing]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Then they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and He brings them out of their distresses. 

<sup>29</sup> 

He hushes the storm to a calm and to a gentle whisper, so that the waves of the sea are still. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Then the men are glad because of the calm, and He brings them to their desired haven. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Oh, that men would praise [and confess to] the Lord for His goodness and loving-kindness and His wonderful works to the children of men! 

<sup>32</sup> 

Let them exalt Him also in the congregation of the people and praise Him in the company of the elders. 

<sup>33</sup> 

He turns rivers into a wilderness, water springs into a thirsty ground, 

<sup>34</sup> 

A fruitful land into a barren, salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it. 

<sup>35</sup> 

He turns a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry ground into water springs; 

<sup>36</sup> 

And there He makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation, 

<sup>37</sup> 

And sow fields, and plant vineyards which yield fruits of increase. 

<sup>38</sup> 

He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly, and allows not their cattle to decrease. 

<sup>39</sup> 

When they are diminished and bowed down through oppression, trouble, and sorrow, 

<sup>40</sup> 

He pours contempt upon princes and causes them to wander in waste places where there is no road. 

<sup>41</sup> 

Yet He raises the poor and needy from affliction and makes their families like a flock. 

<sup>42</sup> 

The upright shall see it and be glad, but all iniquity shall shut its mouth. 

<sup>43</sup> 

Whoso is wise [if there be any truly wise] will observe and heed these things; and they will diligently consider the mercy and loving-kindness of the Lord.
