<sup>1</sup> 

Hear my prayer, O Lord, and let my cry come to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hide not Your face from me in the day when I am in distress! Incline Your ear to me; in the day when I call, answer me speedily. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For my days consume away like smoke, and my bones burn like a firebrand or like a hearth. 

<sup>4</sup> 

My heart is smitten like grass and withered, so that [in absorption] I forget to eat my food. 

<sup>5</sup> 

By reason of my loud groaning [from suffering and trouble] my flesh cleaves to my bones. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I am like a melancholy pelican or vulture of the wilderness; I am like a [desolate] owl of the waste places. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I am sleepless and lie awake [mourning], like a bereaved sparrow alone on the housetop. 

<sup>8</sup> 

My adversaries taunt and reproach me all the day; and they who are angry with me use my name as a curse. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For I have eaten the ashes [in which I sat] as if they were bread and have mingled my drink with weeping 

<sup>10</sup> 

Because of Your indignation and Your wrath, for You have taken me up and cast me away. 

<sup>11</sup> 

My days are like an evening shadow that stretches out and declines [with the sun]; and I am withered like grass. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But You, O Lord, are enthroned forever; and the fame of Your name endures to all generations. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You will arise and have mercy and loving-kindness for Zion, for it is time to have pity and compassion for her; yes, the set time has come [the moment designated]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For Your servants take [melancholy] pleasure in the stones [of her ruins] and show pity for her dust. 

<sup>15</sup> 

So the nations shall fear and worshipfully revere the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth Your glory. 

<sup>16</sup> 

When the Lord builds up Zion, He will appear in His glory; 

<sup>17</sup> 

He will regard the plea of the destitute and will not despise their prayer. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Let this be recorded for the generation yet unborn, that a people yet to be created shall praise the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> 

For He looked down from the height of His sanctuary, from heaven did the Lord behold the earth, 

<sup>20</sup> 

To hear the sighing and groaning of the prisoner, to loose those who are appointed to death, 

<sup>21</sup> 

So that men may declare the name of the Lord in Zion and His praise in Jerusalem 

<sup>22</sup> 

When peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to worship and serve the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He has afflicted and weakened my strength, humbling and bringing me low [with sorrow] in the way; He has shortened my days [aging me prematurely]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, You Whose years continue throughout all generations. 

<sup>25</sup> 

At the beginning You existed and laid the foundations of the earth; the heavens are the work of Your hands. 

<sup>26</sup> 

They shall perish, but You shall remain and endure; yes, all of them shall wear out and become old like a garment. Like clothing You shall change them, and they shall be changed and pass away. 

<sup>27</sup> 

But You remain the same, and Your years shall have no end. 

<sup>28</sup> 

The children of Your servants shall dwell safely and continue, and their descendants shall be established before You.
