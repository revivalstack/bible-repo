<sup>1</sup> 

Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, You Who lead Joseph like a flock; You Who sit enthroned upon the cherubim [of the ark of the covenant], shine forth 

<sup>2</sup> 

Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh! Stir up Your might, and come to save us! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Restore us again, O God; and cause Your face to shine [in pleasure and approval on us], and we shall be saved! 

<sup>4</sup> 

O Lord God of hosts, how long will You be angry with Your people's prayers? 

<sup>5</sup> 

You have fed them with the bread of tears, and You have given them tears to drink in large measure. 

<sup>6</sup> 

You make us a strife and scorn to our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Restore us again, O God of hosts; and cause Your face to shine [upon us with favor as of old], and we shall be saved! 

<sup>8</sup> 

You brought a vine [Israel] out of Egypt; You drove out the [heathen] nations and planted it [in Canaan]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You prepared room before it, and it took deep root and it filled the land. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs of it were like the great cedars [cedars of God]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

[Israel] sent out its boughs to the [Mediterranean] Sea and its branches to the [Euphrates] River. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Why have You broken down its hedges and walls so that all who pass by pluck from its fruit? 

<sup>13</sup> 

The boar out of the wood wastes it and the wild beast of the field feeds on it. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Turn again, we beseech You, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven and see, visit, and have regard for this vine! 

<sup>15</sup> 

[Protect and maintain] the stock which Your right hand planted, and the branch (the son) that You have reared and made strong for Yourself. 

<sup>16</sup> 

They have burned it with fire, it is cut down; may they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand, upon the son of man whom You have made strong for Yourself. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then will we not depart from You; revive us (give us life) and we will call upon Your name. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Restore us, O Lord God of hosts; cause Your face to shine [in pleasure, approval, and favor on us], and we shall be saved!
