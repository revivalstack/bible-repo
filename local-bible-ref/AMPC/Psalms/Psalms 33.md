<sup>1</sup> 

Rejoice in the Lord, O you [uncompromisingly] righteous [you upright in right standing with God]; for praise is becoming and appropriate for those who are upright [in heart]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Give thanks to the Lord with the lyre; sing praises to Him with the harp of ten strings. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully [on the strings] with a loud and joyful sound. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For the word of the Lord is right; and all His work is done in faithfulness. 

<sup>5</sup> 

He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the loving-kindness of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all their host by the breath of His mouth. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He gathers the waters of the sea as in a bottle; He puts the deeps in storage places. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let all the earth fear the Lord [revere and worship Him]; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nought; He makes the thoughts and plans of the peoples of no effect. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the thoughts of His heart through all generations. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people He has chosen as His heritage. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The Lord looks from heaven, He beholds all the sons of men; 

<sup>14</sup> 

From His dwelling place He looks [intently] upon all the inhabitants of the earth-- 

<sup>15</sup> 

He Who fashions the hearts of them all, Who considers all their doings. 

<sup>16</sup> 

No king is saved by the great size and power of his army; a mighty man is not delivered by [his] much strength. 

<sup>17</sup> 

A horse is devoid of value for victory; neither does he deliver any by his great power. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Behold, the Lord's eye is upon those who fear Him [who revere and worship Him with awe], who wait for Him and hope in His mercy and loving-kindness, 

<sup>19</sup> 

To deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Our inner selves wait [earnestly] for the Lord; He is our Help and our Shield. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For in Him does our heart rejoice, because we have trusted (relied on and been confident) in His holy name. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Let Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, be upon us, in proportion to our waiting and hoping for You.
