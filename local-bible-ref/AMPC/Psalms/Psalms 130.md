<sup>1</sup> 

Out of the depths have I cried to You, O Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 

<sup>3</sup> 

If You, Lord, should keep account of and treat [us according to our] sins, O Lord, who could stand? 

<sup>4</sup> 

But there is forgiveness with You [just what man needs], that You may be reverently feared and worshiped. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I wait for the Lord, I expectantly wait, and in His word do I hope. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I am looking and waiting for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, I say, more than watchmen for the morning. 

<sup>7</sup> 

O Israel, hope in the Lord! For with the Lord there is mercy and loving-kindness, and with Him is plenteous redemption. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And He will redeem Israel from all their iniquities.
