<sup>1</sup> 

The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty; the Lord is robed, He has girded Himself with strength and power; the world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up the roaring of their waves. 

<sup>4</sup> 

The Lord on high is mightier and more glorious than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty breakers and waves of the sea. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Your testimonies are very sure; holiness [apparent in separation from sin, with simple trust and hearty obedience] is becoming to Your house, O Lord, forever.
