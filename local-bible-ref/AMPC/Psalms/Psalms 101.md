<sup>1</sup> 

I will sing of mercy and loving-kindness and justice; to You, O Lord, will I sing. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will behave myself wisely and give heed to the blameless way--O when will You come to me? I will walk within my house in integrity and with a blameless heart. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I will set no base or wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of them who turn aside [from the right path]; it shall not grasp hold of me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil person or thing. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Whoso privily slanders his neighbor, him will I cut off [from me]; he who has a haughty look and a proud and arrogant heart I cannot and I will not tolerate. 

<sup>6</sup> 

My eyes shall [look with favor] upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks blamelessly, he shall minister to me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He who works deceit shall not dwell in my house; he who tells lies shall not continue in my presence. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Morning after morning I will root up all the wicked in the land, that I may eliminate all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.
