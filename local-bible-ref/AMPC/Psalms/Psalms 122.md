I was glad when they said to me, Let us go to the house of the Lord! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Our feet are standing within your gates, O Jerusalem!-- 

<sup>3</sup> 

Jerusalem, which is built as a city that is compacted together-- 

<sup>4</sup> 

To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, as was decreed and as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For there the thrones of judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! May they prosper who love you [the Holy City]! 

<sup>7</sup> 

May peace be within your walls and prosperity within your palaces! 

<sup>8</sup> 

For my brethren and companions' sake, I will now say, Peace be within you! 

<sup>9</sup> 

For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek, inquire for, and require your good.
