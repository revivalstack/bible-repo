<sup>1</sup> 

Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth; 

<sup>2</sup> 

Sing forth the honor and glory of His name; make His praise glorious! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Say to God, How awesome and fearfully glorious are Your works! Through the greatness of Your power shall Your enemies submit themselves to You [with feigned and reluctant obedience]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

All the earth shall bow down to You and sing [praises] to You; they shall praise Your name in song. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Come and see the works of God; see how [to save His people He smites their foes; He is] terrible in His doings toward the children of men. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He turned the sea into dry land, they crossed through the river on foot; there did we rejoice in Him. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He rules by His might forever, His eyes observe and keep watch over the nations; let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Bless our God, O peoples, give Him grateful thanks and make the voice of His praise be heard, 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who put and kept us among the living, and has not allowed our feet to slip. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For You, O God, have proved us; You have tried us as silver is tried, refined, and purified. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You brought us into the net (the prison fortress, the dungeon); You laid a heavy burden upon our loins. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You caused men to ride over our heads [when we were prostrate]; we went through fire and through water, but You brought us out into a broad, moist place [to abundance and refreshment and the open air]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

I will come into Your house with burnt offerings [of entire consecration]; I will pay You my vows, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in distress. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I will offer to You burnt offerings of fat lambs, with rams consumed in sweet-smelling smoke; I will offer bullocks and he-goats. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>16</sup> 

Come and hear, all you who reverently and worshipfully fear God, and I will declare what He has done for me! 

<sup>17</sup> 

I cried aloud to Him; He was extolled and high praise was under my tongue. 

<sup>18</sup> 

If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me; 

<sup>19</sup> 

But certainly God has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Blessed be God, Who has not rejected my prayer nor removed His mercy and loving-kindness from being [as it always is] with me.
