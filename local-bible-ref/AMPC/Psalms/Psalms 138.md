<sup>1</sup> 

I will confess and praise You [O God] with my whole heart; before the gods will I sing praises to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will worship toward Your holy temple and praise Your name for Your loving-kindness and for Your truth and faithfulness; for You have exalted above all else Your name and Your word and You have magnified Your word above all Your name! 

<sup>3</sup> 

In the day when I called, You answered me; and You strengthened me with strength (might and inflexibility to temptation) in my inner self. 

<sup>4</sup> 

All the kings of the land shall give You credit and praise You, O Lord, for they have heard of the promises of Your mouth [which were fulfilled]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the Lord and joyfully celebrate His mighty acts, for great is the glory of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For though the Lord is high, yet has He respect to the lowly [bringing them into fellowship with Him]; but the proud and haughty He knows and recognizes [only] at a distance. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and Your right hand will save me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The Lord will perfect that which concerns me; Your mercy and loving-kindness, O Lord, endure forever--forsake not the works of Your own hands.
