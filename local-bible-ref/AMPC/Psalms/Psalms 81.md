Sing aloud to God our Strength! Shout for joy to the God of Jacob! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Raise a song, sound the timbrel, the sweet lyre with the harp. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 

<sup>5</sup> 

This He ordained in Joseph [the savior] for a testimony when He went out over the land of Egypt. The speech of One Whom I knew not did I hear [saying], 

<sup>6</sup> 

I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were freed from the basket. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You called in distress and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you--O Israel, if you would listen to Me! 

<sup>9</sup> 

There shall no strange god be among you, neither shall you worship any alien god. 

<sup>10</sup> 

I am the Lord your God, Who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But My people would not hearken to My voice, and Israel would have none of Me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

So I gave them up to their own hearts' lust and let them go after their own stubborn will, that they might follow their own counsels. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Oh, that My people would listen to Me, that Israel would walk in My ways! 

<sup>14</sup> 

Speedily then I would subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their adversaries. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[Had Israel listened to Me in Egypt, then] those who hated the Lord would have come cringing before Him, and their defeat would have lasted forever. 

<sup>16</sup> 

[God] would feed [Israel now] also with the finest of the wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy you.
