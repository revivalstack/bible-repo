If it had not been the Lord Who was on our side--now may Israel say-- 

<sup>2</sup> 

If it had not been the Lord Who was on our side when men rose up against us, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then they would have quickly swallowed us up alive when their wrath was kindled against us; 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then the waters would have overwhelmed us and swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then the proud waters would have gone over us. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 

<sup>7</sup> 

We are like a bird escaped from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
