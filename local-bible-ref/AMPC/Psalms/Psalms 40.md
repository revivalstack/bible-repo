<sup>1</sup> 

I waited patiently and expectantly for the Lord; and He inclined to me and heard my cry. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He drew me up out of a horrible pit [a pit of tumult and of destruction], out of the miry clay (froth and slime), and set my feet upon a rock, steadying my steps and establishing my goings. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And He has put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many shall see and fear (revere and worship) and put their trust and confident reliance in the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is the man who makes the Lord his refuge and trust, and turns not to the proud or to followers of false gods. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Many, O Lord my God, are the wonderful works which You have done, and Your thoughts toward us; no one can compare with You! If I should declare and speak of them, they are too many to be numbered. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Sacrifice and offering You do not desire, nor have You delight in them; You have given me the capacity to hear and obey [Your law, a more valuable service than] burnt offerings and sin offerings [which] You do not require. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then said I, Behold, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me; 

<sup>8</sup> 

I delight to do Your will, O my God; yes, Your law is within my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I have proclaimed glad tidings of righteousness in the great assembly [tidings of uprightness and right standing with God]. Behold, I have not restrained my lips, as You know, O Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> 

I have not concealed Your righteousness within my heart; I have proclaimed Your faithfulness and Your salvation. I have not hid away Your steadfast love and Your truth from the great assembly. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Withhold not Your tender mercy from me, O Lord; let Your loving-kindness and Your truth continually preserve me! 

<sup>12</sup> 

For innumerable evils have compassed me about; my iniquities have taken such hold on me that I am not able to look up. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart has failed me and forsaken me. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me! 

<sup>14</sup> 

Let them be put to shame and confounded together who seek and require my life to destroy it; let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor who wish me evil and delight in my hurt! 

<sup>15</sup> 

Let them be desolate by reason of their shame who say to me, Aha, aha! 

<sup>16</sup> 

Let all those that seek and require You rejoice and be glad in You; let such as love Your salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified! 

<sup>17</sup> 

[As for me] I am poor and needy, yet the Lord takes thought and plans for me. You are my Help and my Deliverer. O my God, do not tarry!
