<sup>1</sup> 

The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows and proclaims His handiwork. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Day after day pours forth speech, and night after night shows forth knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> 

There is no speech nor spoken word [from the stars]; their voice is not heard. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Yet their voice [in evidence] goes out through all the earth, their sayings to the end of the world. Of the heavens has God made a tent for the sun, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; and it rejoices as a strong man to run his course. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Its going forth is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the ends of it; and nothing [yes, no one] is hidden from the heat of it. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the [whole] person; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure and bright, enlightening the eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The [reverent] fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. 

<sup>10</sup> 

More to be desired are they than gold, even than much fine gold; they are sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Moreover, by them is Your servant warned (reminded, illuminated, and instructed); and in keeping them there is great reward. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Who can discern his lapses and errors? Clear me from hidden [and unconscious] faults. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be blameless, and I shall be innocent and clear of great transgression. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my [firm, impenetrable] Rock and my Redeemer.
