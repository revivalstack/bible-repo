<sup>1</sup> 

O Lord, rebuke me not in Your wrath, neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For Your arrows have sunk into me and stick fast, and Your hand has come down upon me and pressed me sorely. 

<sup>3</sup> 

There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation; neither is there any health or rest in my bones because of my sin. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For my iniquities have gone over my head [like waves of a flood]; as a heavy burden they weigh too much for me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

My wounds are loathsome and corrupt because of my foolishness. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go about mourning all the day long. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh. 

<sup>8</sup> 

I am faint and sorely bruised [deadly cold and quite worn out]; I groan by reason of the disquiet and moaning of my heart. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is not hidden from You. 

<sup>10</sup> 

My heart throbs, my strength fails me; as for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me. 

<sup>11</sup> 

My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; and my neighbors and my near ones stand afar off. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They also that seek and demand my life lay snares for me, and they that seek and require my hurt speak crafty and mischievous things; they meditate treachery and deceit all the day long. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But I, like a deaf man, hear not; and I am like a dumb man who opens not his mouth. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Yes, I have become like a man who hears not, in whose mouth are no arguments or replies. 

<sup>15</sup> 

For in You, O Lord, do I hope; You will answer, O Lord my God. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For I pray, Let them not rejoice over me, who when my foot slips boast against me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For I am ready to halt and fall; my pain and sorrow are continually before me. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For I do confess my guilt and iniquity; I am filled with sorrow for my sin. 

<sup>19</sup> 

But my enemies are vigorous and strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 

<sup>20</sup> 

They also that render evil for good are adversaries to me, because I follow the thing that is good. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Make haste to help me, O Lord, my Salvation.
