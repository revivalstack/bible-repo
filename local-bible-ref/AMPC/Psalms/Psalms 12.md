Help, Lord! For principled and godly people are here no more; faithfulness and the faithful vanish from among the sons of men. 

<sup>2</sup> 

To his neighbor each one speaks words without use or worth or truth; with flattering lips and double heart [deceitfully] they speak. 

<sup>3</sup> 

May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and the tongues that speak proud boasting, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Those who say, With our tongues we prevail; our lips are our own [to command at our will]--who is lord and master over us? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Now will I arise, says the Lord, because the poor are oppressed, because of the groans of the needy; I will set him in safety and in the salvation for which he pants. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The words and promises of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times over. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You will keep them and preserve them, O Lord; You will guard and keep us from this [evil] generation forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The wicked walk or prowl about on every side, as vileness is exalted [and baseness is rated high] among the sons of men.
