<sup>1</sup> 

O sing to the Lord a new song, for He has done marvelous things; His right hand and His holy arm have wrought salvation for Him. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord has made known His salvation; His righteousness has He openly shown in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He has [earnestly] remembered His mercy and loving-kindness, His truth and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have witnessed the salvation of our God. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth; break forth and sing for joy, yes, sing praises! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and the voice of melody. 

<sup>6</sup> 

With trumpets and the sound of the horn make a joyful noise before the King, the Lord! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let the sea roar, and all that fills it, the world, and those who dwell in it! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let the rivers clap their hands; together let the hills sing for joy 

<sup>9</sup> 

Before the Lord, for He is coming to judge [and rule] the earth; with righteousness will He judge [and rule] the world, and the peoples with equity.
