<sup>1</sup> 

Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, and in Your righteousness. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And enter not into judgment with Your servant, for in Your sight no man living is [in himself] righteous or justified. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For the enemy has pursued and persecuted my soul, he has crushed my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in dark places as those who have been long dead. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed and faints within me [wrapped in gloom]; my heart within my bosom grows numb. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your doings; I ponder the work of Your hands. 

<sup>6</sup> 

I spread forth my hands to You; my soul thirsts after You like a thirsty land [for water]. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Answer me speedily, O Lord, for my spirit fails; hide not Your face from me, lest I become like those who go down into the pit (the grave). 

<sup>8</sup> 

Cause me to hear Your loving-kindness in the morning, for on You do I lean and in You do I trust. Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk, for I lift up my inner self to You. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; I flee to You to hide me. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God; let Your good Spirit lead me into a level country and into the land of uprightness. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Save my life, O Lord, for Your name's sake; in Your righteousness, bring my life out of trouble and free me from distress. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And in your mercy and loving-kindness, cut off my enemies and destroy all those who afflict my inner self, for I am Your servant.
