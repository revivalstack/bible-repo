We give praise and thanks to You, O God, we praise and give thanks; Your wondrous works declare that Your Name is near and they who invoke Your Name rehearse Your wonders.

When the proper time has come [for executing My judgments], I will judge uprightly [says the Lord]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

When the earth totters, and all the inhabitants of it, it is I Who will poise and keep steady its pillars. Selah [pause, and calmly think of that]! 

<sup>4</sup> 

I said to the arrogant and boastful, Deal not arrogantly [do not boast]; and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn [of personal aggrandizement]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Lift not up your [aggressive] horn on high, speak not with a stiff neck and insolent arrogance. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For not from the east nor from the west nor from the south come promotion and lifting up. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But God is the Judge! He puts down one and lifts up another. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup [of His wrath], and the wine foams and is red, well mixed; and He pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth must drain it and drink its dregs. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But I will declare and rejoice forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

<sup>10</sup> 

All the horns of the ungodly also will I cut off [says the Lord], but the horns of the [uncompromisingly] righteous shall be exalted.
