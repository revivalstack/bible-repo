<sup>1</sup> 

Those who trust in, lean on, and confidently hope in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides and stands fast forever. 

<sup>2</sup> 

As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people from this time forth and forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the [uncompromisingly] righteous, lest the righteous (God's people) stretch forth their hands to iniquity and apostasy. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, and to those who are right [with You and all people] in their hearts. 

<sup>5</sup> 

As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways [of indifference to God], the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel!
