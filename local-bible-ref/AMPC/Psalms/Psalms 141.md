<sup>1</sup> 

Lord, I call upon You; hasten to me. Give ear to my voice when I cry to You. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Let my prayer be set forth as incense before You, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Set a guard, O Lord, before my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Incline my heart not to submit or consent to any evil thing or to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let the righteous man smite and correct me--it is a kindness. Oil so choice let not my head refuse or discourage; for even in their evils or calamities shall my prayer continue. 

<sup>6</sup> 

When their rulers are overthrown in stony places, [their followers] shall hear my words, that they are sweet (pleasant, mild, and just). 

<sup>7</sup> 

The unburied bones [of slaughtered rulers] shall lie scattered at the mouth of Sheol, [as unregarded] as the lumps of soil behind the plowman when he breaks open the ground. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But my eyes are toward You, O God the Lord; in You do I trust and take refuge; pour not out my life nor leave it destitute and bare. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me, and the snares of evildoers. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass over them and escape.
