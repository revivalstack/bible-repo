O God, the nations have come into [the land of Your people] Your inheritance; Your sacred temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem heaps of ruins. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The dead bodies of Your servants they have given as food to the birds of the heavens, the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Their blood they have poured out like water round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[Because of such humiliation] we have become a taunt and reproach to our neighbors, a mocking and derision to those who are round about us. 

<sup>5</sup> 

How long, O Lord? Will You be angry forever? Shall Your jealousy [which cannot endure a divided allegiance] burn like fire? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Pour out Your wrath on the Gentile nations who do not acknowledge You, and upon the kingdoms that do not call on Your name. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling and his pasture. 

<sup>8</sup> 

O do not [earnestly] remember against us the iniquities and guilt of our forefathers! Let Your compassion and tender mercy speedily come to meet us, for we are brought very low. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name! Deliver us, forgive us, and purge away our sins for Your name's sake. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Why should the Gentile nations say, Where is their God? Let vengeance for the blood of Your servants which is poured out be known among the nations in our sight [not delaying until some future generation]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let the groaning and sighing of the prisoner come before You; according to the greatness of Your power and Your arm spare those who are appointed to die! 

<sup>12</sup> 

And return into the bosom of our neighbors sevenfold the taunts with which they have taunted and scoffed at You, O Lord! 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, will give You thanks forever; we will show forth and publish Your praise from generation to generation.
