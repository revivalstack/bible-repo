Blessed (happy, fortunate, to be envied) is he who considers the weak and the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the time of evil and trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord will protect him and keep him alive; he shall be called blessed in the land; and You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The Lord will sustain, refresh, and strengthen him on his bed of languishing; all his bed You [O Lord] will turn, change, and transform in his illness. 

<sup>4</sup> 

I said, Lord, be merciful and gracious to me; heal my inner self, for I have sinned against You. 

<sup>5</sup> 

My enemies speak evil of me, [saying], When will he die and his name perish? 

<sup>6</sup> 

And when one comes to see me, he speaks falsehood and empty words, while his heart gathers mischievous gossip [against me]; when he goes away, he tells it abroad. 

<sup>7</sup> 

All who hate me whisper together about me; against me do they devise my hurt [imagining the worst for me]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

An evil disease, say they, is poured out upon him and cleaves fast to him; and now that he is bedfast, he will not rise up again. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Even my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted (relied on and was confident), who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But You, O Lord, be merciful and gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 

<sup>11</sup> 

By this I know that You favor and delight in me, because my enemy does not triumph over me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And as for me, You have upheld me in my integrity and set me in Your presence forever. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting [from this age to the next, and forever]! Amen and Amen (so be it).
