O sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Sing to the Lord, bless (affectionately praise) His name; show forth His salvation from day to day. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Declare His glory among the nations, His marvelous works among all the peoples. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised; He is to be reverently feared and worshiped above all [so-called] gods. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For all the gods of the nations are [lifeless] idols, but the Lord made the heavens. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Honor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Ascribe to the Lord, O you families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Give to the Lord the glory due His name; bring an offering and come [before Him] into His courts. 

<sup>9</sup> 

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; tremble before and reverently fear Him, all the earth. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Say among the nations that the Lord reigns; the world also is established, so that it cannot be moved; He shall judge and rule the people righteously and with justice. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all the things which fill it; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Let the field be exultant, and all that is in it! Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy 

<sup>13</sup> 

Before the Lord, for He comes, for He comes to judge and govern the earth! He shall judge the world with righteousness and justice and the peoples with His faithfulness and truth.
