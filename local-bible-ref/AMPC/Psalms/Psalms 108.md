O God, my heart is fixed (steadfast, in the confidence of faith); I will sing, yes, I will sing praises, even with my glory [all the faculties and powers of one created in Your image]! 

<sup>2</sup> 

Awake, harp and lyre; I myself will wake very early--I will waken the dawn! 

<sup>3</sup> 

I will praise and give thanks to You, O Lord, among the peoples; and I will sing praises unto You among the nations. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For Your mercy and loving-kindness are great and high as the heavens! Your truth and faithfulness reach to the skies! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Be exalted, O God, above the heavens, and let Your glory be over all the earth. 

<sup>6</sup> 

That Your beloved [followers] may be delivered, save with Your right hand and answer us! [or me]! 

<sup>7</sup> 

God has promised in His holiness [regarding the establishment of David's dynasty]: I will rejoice, I will distribute [Canaan among My people], dividing Shechem and [the western region and allotting the eastern region which contains] the Valley of Succoth. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim also is My stronghold and the defense of My head; Judah is My scepter and lawgiver. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom [My slave] My shoe I cast [to be cleaned]; over Philistia I shout [in triumph]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who will bring me [David] into the strong, fortified city [of Petra]? Who will lead me into Edom? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Have You not cast us off, O God? And will You not go forth, O God, with our armies? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Give us help against the adversary, for vain is the help of man. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Through and with God we shall do valiantly, for He it is Who shall tread down our adversaries.
