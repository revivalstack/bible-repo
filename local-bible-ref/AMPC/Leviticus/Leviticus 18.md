<sup>1</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>3</sup> 

You shall not do as was done in the land of Egypt in which you dwelt, nor shall you do as is done in the land of Canaan to which I am bringing you; neither shall you walk in their statutes. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You shall do My ordinances and keep My statutes and walk in them. I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>5</sup> 

You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which, if a man does, he shall live by them. I am the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

None of you shall approach anyone close of kin to him to have sexual relations. I am the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother, you shall not uncover; she is your mother; you shall not have intercourse with her. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The nakedness of your father's wife you shall not uncover; it is your father's nakedness. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You shall not have intercourse with or uncover the nakedness of your sister, the daughter of your father or of your mother, whether born at home or born abroad. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You must not have sexual relations with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter; their nakedness you shall not uncover, for they are your own flesh. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You must not have intercourse with your father's wife's daughter; begotten by your father, she is your sister; you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You shall not have intercourse with your father's sister; she is your father's near kinswoman. 

<sup>13</sup> 

You shall not have sexual relations with your mother's sister, for she is your mother's near kinswoman. 

<sup>14</sup> 

You shall not have intercourse with your father's brother's wife; you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt. 

<sup>15</sup> 

You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife; you shall not have intercourse with her. 

<sup>16</sup> 

You shall not have intercourse with your brother's wife; she belongs to your brother. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You shall not marry a woman and her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to have intercourse; they are [her] near kinswomen; it is wickedness and an outrageous offense. 

<sup>18</sup> 

You must not marry a woman in addition to her sister, to be a rival to her, having sexual relations with the second sister when the first one is alive. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Also you shall not have intercourse with a woman during her [menstrual period or similar] uncleanness. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Moreover, you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to defile yourself with her. 

<sup>21</sup> 

You shall not give any of your children to pass through the fire and sacrifice them to Molech [the fire god], nor shall you profane the name of your God [by giving it to false gods]. I am the Lord. 

<sup>22</sup> 

You shall not lie with a man as with a woman; it is an abomination. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Neither shall you lie with any beast and defile yourself with it; neither shall any woman yield herself to a beast to lie with it; it is confusion, perversion, and degradedly carnal. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for in all these things the nations are defiled which I am casting out before you. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And the land is defiled; therefore I visit the iniquity of it upon it, and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants. 

<sup>26</sup> 

So you shall keep My statutes and My ordinances and shall not commit any of these abominations, neither the native-born nor any stranger who sojourns among you, 

<sup>27</sup> 

For all these abominations have the men of the land done who were before you, and the land is defiled-- 

<sup>28</sup> 

[Do none of these things] lest the land spew you out when you defile it as it spewed out the nation that was before you. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Whoever commits any of these abominations shall be cut off from among [his] people. 

<sup>30</sup> 

So keep My charge: do not practice any of these abominable customs which were practiced before you and defile yourselves by them. I am the Lord your God.
