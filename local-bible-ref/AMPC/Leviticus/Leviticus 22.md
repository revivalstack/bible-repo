And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to Aaron and his sons that they shall stay away from the holy things which the Israelites dedicate to Me, that they may not profane My holy name; I am the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Tell them, Any one of your offspring throughout your generations who goes to the holy things which the Israelites dedicate to the Lord when he is unclean, that [priest] shall be cut off from My presence and excluded from the sanctuary; I am the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 

No man of the offspring of Aaron who is a leper or has a discharge shall eat of the holy things [the offerings and the showbread] until he is clean. And whoever touches any person or thing made unclean by contact with a corpse or a man who has had a discharge of semen, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Or whoever touches any dead creeping thing by which he may be made unclean, or a man from whom he may acquire uncleanness, whatever it may be, 

<sup>6</sup> 

The priest who has touched any such thing shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed with water. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When the sun is down, he shall be clean, and afterward may eat of the holy things, for they are his food. 

<sup>8</sup> 

That which dies of itself or is torn by beasts he shall not eat, defiling himself with it. I am the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The priests therefore shall observe My ordinance, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby if they profane it. I am the Lord, Who sanctifies them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

No outsider [not of the family of Aaron] shall eat of the holy thing [which has been offered to God]; a sojourner with the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But if a priest buys a slave with his money, the slave may eat of the holy thing, and he also who is born in the priest's house; they may eat of his food. 

<sup>12</sup> 

If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider [not of the priestly tribe], she shall not eat of the offering of the holy things. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But if a priest's daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no child, and returns to her father's house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's food; but no stranger shall eat of it. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And if a man eats unknowingly of the holy thing [which has been offered to God], then he shall add one-fifth of its value to it and repay that amount to the priest for the holy thing. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The priests shall not profane the holy things the Israelites offer to the Lord, 

<sup>16</sup> 

And so cause them [by neglect of any essential observance] to bear the iniquity when they eat their holy things; for I the Lord sanctify them. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>18</sup> 

Say to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites, Whoever of the house of Israel and of the foreigners in Israel brings his offering, whether to pay a vow or as a freewill offering which is offered to the Lord for a burnt offering 

<sup>19</sup> 

That you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish of the young bulls, the sheep, or the goats. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But you shall not offer anything which has a blemish, for it will not be acceptable for you. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord to make a special vow to the Lord or for a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock must bring what is perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Animals blind or made infirm and weak or maimed, or having sores or a wen or an itch or scabs, you shall not offer to the Lord or make an offering of them by fire upon the altar to the Lord. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For a freewill offering you may offer either a bull or a lamb which has some part too long or too short, but for [the payment of] a vow it shall not be accepted. 

<sup>24</sup> 

You shall not offer to the Lord any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or broken or cut, neither sacrifice it in your land. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Neither shall you offer as the bread of your God any such animals obtained from a foreigner [who may wish to pay respect to the true God], because their defects render them unfit; there is a blemish in them; they will not be accepted for you. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>27</sup> 

When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain for seven days with its mother; and from the eighth day on it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And whether [the mother] is a cow or a ewe, you shall not kill her and her young both in one day. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And when you sacrifice an offering of thanksgiving to the Lord, sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. 

<sup>30</sup> 

It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the next day. I am the Lord. 

<sup>31</sup> 

So shall you heartily accept My commandments and conform your life and conduct to them. I am the Lord. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Neither shall you profane My holy name [applying it to an idol, or treating it with irreverence or contempt or as a byword]; but I will be hallowed among the Israelites. I am the Lord, Who consecrates and makes you holy, 

<sup>33</sup> 

Who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.
