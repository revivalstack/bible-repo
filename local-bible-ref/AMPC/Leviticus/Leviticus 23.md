The Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, The set feasts or appointed seasons of the Lord which you shall proclaim as holy convocations, even My set feasts, are these: 

<sup>3</sup> 

Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation or assembly by summons. You shall do no work on that day; it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings. 

<sup>4</sup> 

These are the set feasts or appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations you shall proclaim at their stated times: 

<sup>5</sup> 

On the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight is the Lord's Passover. 

<sup>6</sup> 

On the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. 

<sup>7</sup> 

On the first day you shall have a holy "calling together;" you shall do no servile or laborious work on that day. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord for seven days; on the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall do no servile or laborious work on that day. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Tell the Israelites, When you have come into the land I give you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, that you may be accepted; on the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it [before the Lord]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You shall offer on the day when you wave the sheaf a male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Its cereal offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering made by fire to the Lord for a sweet, pleasing, and satisfying fragrance; and the drink offering of it [to be poured out] shall be of wine, a fourth of a hin. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And you shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor green ears, until this same day when you have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your houses. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And you shall count from the day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, seven Sabbaths; [seven full weeks] shall they be. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a cereal offering of new grain to the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You shall bring from your dwellings two loaves of bread to be waved, made from two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for firstfruits to the Lord. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And you shall offer with the bread seven lambs, a year old and without blemish, and one young bull and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the Lord, with their cereal offering and their drink offerings, an offering made by fire, of a sweet and satisfying fragrance to the Lord. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then you shall sacrifice one he-goat for a sin offering and two he-lambs, a year old, for a sacrifice of peace offering. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The priest shall wave the two lambs, together with the bread of the firstfruits, for a wave offering before the Lord. They shall be holy to the Lord for the priest. 

<sup>21</sup> 

You shall make proclamation the same day, summoning a holy assembly; you shall do no servile work that day. It shall be a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>24</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, On the first day of the seventh month [almost October], you shall observe a day of solemn [sabbatical] rest, a memorial day announced by blowing of trumpets, a holy [called] assembly. 

<sup>25</sup> 

You shall do no servile work on it, but you shall present an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Also the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; it shall be a holy [called] assembly, and you shall afflict yourselves [by fasting in penitence and humility] and present an offering made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And you shall do no work on this day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the Lord your God. 

<sup>29</sup> 

For whoever is not afflicted [by fasting in penitence and humility] on this day shall be cut off from among his people [that he may not be included in the atonement made for them]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And whoever does any work on that same day I will destroy from among his people. 

<sup>31</sup> 

You shall do no kind of work [on that day]. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 

<sup>32</sup> 

It shall be to you a sabbath of rest, and you shall afflict yourselves [by fasting in penitence and humility]. On the ninth day of the month from evening to evening you shall keep your sabbath. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>34</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, The fifteenth day of this seventh month, and for seven days, is the Feast of Tabernacles or Booths to the Lord. 

<sup>35</sup> 

On the first day shall be a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work on that day. 

<sup>36</sup> 

For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation and you shall present an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no laborious work on that day. 

<sup>37</sup> 

These are the set feasts or appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to present an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt offering and a cereal offering, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its own day. 

<sup>38</sup> 

This is in addition to the Sabbaths of the Lord and besides your gifts and all your vowed offerings and all your freewill offerings which you give to the Lord. 

<sup>39</sup> 

Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month [nearly October], when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep the feast of the Lord for seven days, the first day and the eighth day each a Sabbath. 

<sup>40</sup> 

And on the first day you shall take the fruit of pleasing trees [and make booths of them], branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick (leafy) trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. 

<sup>41</sup> 

You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year, a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month. 

<sup>42</sup> 

You shall dwell in booths (shelters) for seven days: All native Israelites shall dwell in booths, 

<sup>43</sup> 

That your generations may know that I made the Israelites dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>44</sup> 

Thus Moses declared to the Israelites the set or appointed feasts of the Lord.
