<sup>1</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, If anyone shall sin through error or unwittingly in any of the things which the Lord has commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them-- 

<sup>3</sup> 

If it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin which he has committed a young bull without blemish to the Lord as a sin offering. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting before the Lord, and shall lay [both] his hands on the bull's head and kill [it] before the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the anointed priest shall take some of the bull's blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting; 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of [it] seven times before the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord which is in the Tent of Meeting; and all the rest of the blood of the bull shall he pour out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And all the fat of the bull for the sin offering he shall take off of it--the fat that covers and is on the entrails, 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which he shall take away with the kidneys-- 

<sup>10</sup> 

Just as these are taken off of the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, its head, its legs, its entrails, and its dung, 

<sup>12</sup> 

Even the whole bull shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on a fire of wood, there where the ashes are poured out. 

<sup>13</sup> 

If the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and it be hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done what the Lord has commanded not to be done and are guilty, 

<sup>14</sup> 

When the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the congregation shall offer a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bull before the Lord, and the bull shall be killed before the Lord. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The anointed priest shall bring some of the bull's blood to the Tent of Meeting, 

<sup>17</sup> 

And shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, before the veil [which screens the ark of the covenant]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar [of incense] which is before the Lord in the Tent of Meeting, and he shall pour out all the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering near the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And he shall take all its fat from the bull and burn it on the altar. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull for a sin offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for [the people], and they shall be forgiven. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And he shall carry forth the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the congregation. 

<sup>22</sup> 

When a ruler or leader sins and unwittingly does any one of the things the Lord his God has forbidden, and is guilty, 

<sup>23</sup> 

If his sin which he has committed be known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord; it is a sin offering. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and pour the rest of its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And he shall burn all its fat upon the altar like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; so the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 

<sup>27</sup> 

If any one of the common people sins unwittingly in doing anything the Lord has commanded not to be done, and is guilty, 

<sup>28</sup> 

When the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed. 

<sup>29</sup> 

The offender shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and kill [it] at the place of the burnt offering. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And all the fat of it he shall take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet and satisfying fragrance to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for [the man], and he shall be forgiven. 

<sup>32</sup> 

If he brings a lamb as his sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish. 

<sup>33</sup> 

He shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 

<sup>34</sup> 

And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and all the rest of the blood of the lamb he shall pour out at the base of the altar. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And he shall take away all the fat of it, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar upon the offerings made by fire to the Lord; and the priest shall make atonement for the sin which the man has committed, and he shall be forgiven.
