And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Command the Israelites that they bring to you pure oil from beaten olives for the light [of the golden lampstand] to cause a lamp to burn continually. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Outside the veil of the Testimony [between the Holy and the Most Holy Places] in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall keep it in order from evening to morning before the Lord continually; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. 

<sup>4</sup> 

He shall keep the lamps in order upon the lampstand of pure gold before the Lord continually. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake [of the showbread or bread of the Presence]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And you shall set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the table of pure gold before the Lord. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You shall put pure frankincense [in a bowl or spoon] beside each row, that it may be with the bread as a memorial portion, an offering to be made by fire to the Lord. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Every Sabbath day Aaron shall set the showbread in order before the Lord continually; it is on behalf of the Israelites, an everlasting covenant. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And the bread shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is for [Aaron] a most holy portion of the offerings to the Lord made by fire, a perpetual due [to the high priest]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the Israelites, and he and a man of Israel quarreled and strove together in the camp. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name [of the Lord] and cursed. They brought him to Moses--his mother was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And they put him in custody until the will of the Lord might be declared to them. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And the Lord said to Moses, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Bring him who has cursed out of the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands upon his head; then let all the congregation stone him. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And you shall say to the Israelites, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he who blasphemes the Name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him; the stranger as well as he who was born in the land shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name [of the Lord]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And he who kills any man shall surely be put to death. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And he who kills a beast shall make it good, beast for beast. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And if a man causes a blemish or disfigurement on his neighbor, it shall be done to him as he has done: 

<sup>20</sup> 

Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has caused a blemish or disfigurement on a man, so shall it be done to him. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He who kills a beast shall replace it; he who kills a man shall be put to death. 

<sup>22</sup> 

You shall have the same law for the sojourner among you as for one of your own nationality, for I am the Lord your God. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they brought him who had cursed out of the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
