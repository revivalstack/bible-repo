The Lord called to Moses out of the Tent of Meeting, and said to him, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Say to the Israelites, When any man of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of [domestic] animals from the herd or from the flock. 

<sup>3</sup> 

If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before the Lord. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And he shall lay [both] his hands upon the head of the burnt offering [transferring symbolically his guilt to the victim], and it shall be an acceptable atonement for him. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The man shall kill the young bull before the Lord, and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall present the blood and dash [it] round about upon the altar that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And he shall skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and lay wood in order on the fire; 

<sup>8</sup> 

And Aaron's sons the priests shall lay the pieces, the head and the fat, in order on the wood on the fire on the altar. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a sweet and satisfying odor to the Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And if the man's offering is of the flock, from the sheep or the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer a male without blemish. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the Lord, and Aaron's sons the priests shall dash its blood round about against the altar. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And [the man] shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire on the altar. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But he shall wash the entrails and legs with water. The priest shall offer all of it and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet and satisfying fragrance to the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And if the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, then [the man] shall bring turtledoves or young pigeons. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he shall take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And he shall split it open [holding it] by its wings, but shall not cut it in two. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a sweet and satisfying odor to the Lord.
