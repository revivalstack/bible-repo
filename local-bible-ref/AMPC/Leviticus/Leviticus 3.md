And from the sacrifice of the peace offering, an offering made by fire to the Lord, he shall offer the fat that covers and is upon the entrails,

<sup>9</sup> 

And he shall offer from the peace offering as an offering made by fire to the Lord: the fat of it, the fat tail as a whole, taking it off close to the backbone, and the fat that covers and is upon the entrails, 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the two kidneys, and the fat on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver, which he shall take away with the kidneys.

The priest shall burn it upon the altar, a food offering made by fire to the Lord.

And lay his hands upon its head, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall throw its blood against the altar round about. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then he shall offer from it as his offering made by fire to the Lord: the fat that covers and is on the entrails, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the two kidneys and the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The priest shall burn them on the altar as food, offered by fire, for a sweet and satisfying fragrance. All the fat is the Lord's. 

<sup>17</sup> 

It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations in all your dwelling places, that you eat neither fat nor blood.
