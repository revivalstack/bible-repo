<sup>1</sup> 

So by whatever [appeal to you there is in our mutual dwelling in Christ, by whatever] strengthening and consoling and encouraging [our relationship] in Him [affords], by whatever persuasive incentive there is in love, by whatever participation in the [Holy] Spirit [we share], and by whatever depth of affection and compassionate sympathy, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Fill up and complete my joy by living in harmony and being of the same mind and one in purpose, having the same love, being in full accord and of one harmonious mind and intention. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Do nothing from factional motives [through contentiousness, strife, selfishness, or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance. Instead, in the true spirit of humility (lowliness of mind) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Let each of you esteem and look upon and be concerned for not [merely] his own interests, but also each for the interests of others. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let this same attitude and purpose and [humble] mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus: [Let Him be your example in humility:] 

<sup>6</sup> 

Who, although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God], did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped or retained, 

<sup>7</sup> 

But stripped Himself [of all privileges and rightful dignity], so as to assume the guise of a servant (slave), in that He became like men and was born a human being. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And after He had appeared in human form, He abased and humbled Himself [still further] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death, even the death of the cross! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Therefore [because He stooped so low] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, 

<sup>10</sup> 

That in (at) the name of Jesus every knee should (must) bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And every tongue [frankly and openly] confess and acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Therefore, my dear ones, as you have always obeyed [my suggestions], so now, not only [with the enthusiasm you would show] in my presence but much more because I am absent, work out (cultivate, carry out to the goal, and fully complete) your own salvation with reverence and awe and trembling (self-distrust, with serious caution, tenderness of conscience, watchfulness against temptation, timidly shrinking from whatever might offend God and discredit the name of Christ). 

<sup>13</sup> 

[Not in your own strength] for it is God Who is all the while effectually at work in you [energizing and creating in you the power and desire], both to will and to work for His good pleasure and satisfaction and delight. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Do all things without grumbling and faultfinding and complaining [against God] and questioning and doubting [among yourselves], 

<sup>15</sup> 

That you may show yourselves to be blameless and guileless, innocent and uncontaminated, children of God without blemish (faultless, unrebukable) in the midst of a crooked and wicked generation [spiritually perverted and perverse], among whom you are seen as bright lights (stars or beacons shining out clearly) in the [dark] world, 

<sup>16</sup> 

Holding out [to it] and offering [to all men] the Word of Life, so that in the day of Christ I may have something of which exultantly to rejoice and glory in that I did not run my race in vain or spend my labor to no purpose. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Even if [my lifeblood] must be poured out as a libation on the sacrificial offering of your faith [to God], still I am glad [to do it] and congratulate you all on [your share in] it. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And you also in like manner be glad and congratulate me on [my share in] it. 

<sup>19</sup> 

But I hope and trust in the Lord Jesus soon to send Timothy to you, so that I may also be encouraged and cheered by learning news of you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

For I have no one like him [no one of so kindred a spirit] who will be so genuinely interested in your welfare and devoted to your interests. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For the others all seek [to advance] their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ (the Messiah). 

<sup>22</sup> 

But Timothy's tested worth you know, how as a son with his father he has toiled with me zealously in [serving and helping to advance] the good news (the Gospel). 

<sup>23</sup> 

I hope therefore to send him promptly, just as soon as I know how my case is going to turn out. 

<sup>24</sup> 

But [really] I am confident and fully trusting in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come to you also. 

<sup>25</sup> 

However, I thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus [back] to you. [He has been] my brother and companion in labor and my fellow soldier, as well as [having come as] your special messenger (apostle) and minister to my need. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For he has been [homesick] longing for you all and has been distressed because you had heard that he was ill. 

<sup>27</sup> 

He certainly was ill [too], near to death. But God had compassion on him, and not only on him but also on me, lest I should have sorrow [over him] coming upon sorrow. 

<sup>28</sup> 

So I have sent him the more willingly and eagerly, that you may be gladdened at seeing him again, and that I may be the less disquieted. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Welcome him [home] then in the Lord with all joy, and honor and highly appreciate men like him, 

<sup>30</sup> 

For it was through working for Christ that he came so near death, risking his [very] life to complete the deficiencies in your service to me [which distance prevented you yourselves from rendering].
