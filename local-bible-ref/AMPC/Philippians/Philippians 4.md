<sup>1</sup> 

Therefore, my brethren, whom I love and yearn to see, my delight and crown (wreath of victory), thus stand firm in the Lord, my beloved. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I entreat and advise Euodia and I entreat and advise Syntyche to agree and to work in harmony in the Lord. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And I exhort you too, [my] genuine yokefellow, help these [two women to keep on cooperating], for they have toiled along with me in [the spreading of] the good news (the Gospel), as have Clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the Book of Life. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Rejoice in the Lord always [delight, gladden yourselves in Him]; again I say, Rejoice! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let all men know and perceive and recognize your unselfishness (your considerateness, your forbearing spirit). The Lord is near [He is coming soon]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And God's peace [shall be yours, that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is, that peace] which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For the rest, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable, whatever is kind and winsome and gracious, if there is any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things [fix your minds on them]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and model your way of living on it, and the God of peace (of untroubled, undisturbed well-being) will be with you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

I was made very happy in the Lord that now you have revived your interest in my welfare after so long a time; you were indeed thinking of me, but you had no opportunity to show it. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Not that I am implying that I was in any personal want, for I have learned how to be  content (satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or disquieted) in whatever state I am. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I know how to be abased and live humbly in straitened circumstances, and I know also how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance. I have learned in any and all circumstances the secret of facing every situation, whether well-fed or going hungry, having a sufficiency and enough to spare or going without and being in want. 

<sup>13</sup> 

I have strength for all things in Christ Who empowers me [I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him Who infuses inner strength into me; I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But it was right and commendable and noble of you to contribute for my needs and to share my difficulties with me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And you Philippians yourselves well know that in the early days of the Gospel ministry, when I left Macedonia, no church (assembly) entered into partnership with me and opened up [a debit and credit] account in giving and receiving except you only. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For even in Thessalonica you sent [me contributions] for my needs, not only once but a second time. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Not that I seek or am eager for [your] gift, but I do seek and am eager for the fruit which increases to your credit [the harvest of blessing that is accumulating to your account]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But I have [your full payment] and more; I have everything I need and am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. [They are the] fragrant odor of an offering and sacrifice which God welcomes and in which He delights. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And my God will liberally supply (fill to the full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 

<sup>20</sup> 

To our God and Father be glory forever and ever (through the endless eternities of the eternities). Amen (so be it). 

<sup>21</sup> 

Remember me to every saint (every born-again believer) in Christ Jesus. The brethren (my associates) who are with me greet you. 

<sup>22</sup> 

All the saints (God's consecrated ones here) wish to be remembered to you, especially those of Caesar's household. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The grace (spiritual favor and blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ (the Anointed One) be with your spirit. Amen (so be it).
