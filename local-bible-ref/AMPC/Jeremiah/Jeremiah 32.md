The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. 

<sup>2</sup> 

For the king of Babylon's army was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the house of the king of Judah. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For Zedekiah king of Judah had locked him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hands of the Chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye; 

<sup>5</sup> 

And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him [for evil], says the Lord; and though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not prosper [why do you thus prophesy]? 

<sup>6</sup> 

And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Behold, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you and say, Buy my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard in accordance with the word of the Lord, and he said to me, I pray you, buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin, for the right of inheritance is yours and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And I bought the field that was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle's son and weighed out for him the money--seventeen shekels of silver. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And I signed the deed and sealed it, called witnesses, and weighed out for him the money on the scales. 

<sup>11</sup> 

So I took the deed of the purchase--both that which was sealed, containing the terms and conditions, and the copy which was unsealed-- 

<sup>12</sup> 

And I gave the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle's son and the witnesses who signed the purchase deed, in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this unsealed deed, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last a long time. 

<sup>15</sup> 

For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be purchased yet again in this land. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord, saying: 

<sup>17</sup> 

Alas, Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! There is nothing too hard or too wonderful for You-- 

<sup>18</sup> 

You Who show loving-kindness to thousands but recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosoms of their children after them. The great, the mighty God; the Lord of hosts is His name-- 

<sup>19</sup> 

Great [are You] in counsel and mighty in deeds, Whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to reward or repay each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings, 

<sup>20</sup> 

Who wrought signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day [continues to do so], both in Israel and among other men, and made for Yourself a name, as at this day. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And You brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm and with great terror; 

<sup>22</sup> 

And You gave them this land which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 

<sup>23</sup> 

And they entered and took possession of it, but they obeyed not Your voice, nor walked in Your law; they have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do. Therefore You have caused all this evil to come upon them. 

<sup>24</sup> 

See the siege mounds [of earth which the foe has heaped against the walls]; they have come up to the city to take it. And the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because [the people are overcome] by the sword and the famine and the pestilence. What You have spoken has come to pass, and behold, You see it. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Yet, O Lord God, You said to me, Buy the field with money and get witnesses, even though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Then came the word of the Lord to Jeremiah, saying, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is there anything too hard for Me? 

<sup>28</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 

<sup>29</sup> 

And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come in and set this city on fire and burn it, along with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to provoke Me to anger. 

<sup>30</sup> 

For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth; for the children of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands [the idols], says the Lord. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For this city has been to Me a [such a] provocation of My anger and My wrath from the day that they [finished] building it [in the time of Solomon, who was the first Israelite king who turned to idolatry] even to this day that I must remove it from before My face-- 

<sup>32</sup> 

Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger--they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

<sup>33</sup> 

And they have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; though I taught them persistently, yet they would not listen and receive instruction. 

<sup>34</sup> 

But they set their abominations [of idol worship] in the house which is called by My Name to defile it. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And they built the high places [for worship] of Baal in the Valley of Ben-hinnom [son of Hinnom] to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire [in worship also of and] to Molech--which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind or heart that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. 

<sup>36</sup> 

And now therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword and by famine and by pestilence: 

<sup>37</sup> 

Behold, I will gather them out of all countries to which I drove them in My anger and in My wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them again to this place, and I will make them dwell safely. 

<sup>38</sup> 

And they will be My people, and I will be their God. 

<sup>39</sup> 

And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may [reverently] fear Me forever for the good of themselves and of their children after them. 

<sup>40</sup> 

And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will not turn away from following them to do them good, and I will put My [reverential] fear in their hearts, so that they will not depart from Me. 

<sup>41</sup> 

Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly and in truth with My whole heart and with My whole being. 

<sup>42</sup> 

For thus says the Lord: As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. 

<sup>43</sup> 

And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans. 

<sup>44</sup> 

Men shall buy fields for money and shall sign deeds, seal them, and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South (the Negeb), for I will cause them to be released from their exile, says the Lord.
