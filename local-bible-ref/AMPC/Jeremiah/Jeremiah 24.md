After Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me [in a vision] two baskets of figs set before the temple of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 

One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then the Lord said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs--the good figs very good, and the bad very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so will I regard the captives of Judah whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For I will set My eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land; and I will build them up and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And I will give them a heart to know (recognize, understand, and be acquainted with) Me, that I am the Lord; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And as for the bad figs, which are so bad that they cannot be eaten, surely thus says the Lord, So will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes and the residue of Jerusalem who remains in this land and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. 

<sup>9</sup> 

I will even give them up to be a dismay and a horror and to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach, a byword or proverb, a taunt, and a curse in all places where I will drive them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence among them until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.
