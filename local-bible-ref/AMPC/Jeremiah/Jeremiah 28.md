In that same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year and the fifth month, Hananiah son of Azzur, the [false] prophet, who was from Gibeon [one of the priests' cities], said [falsely] to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Within two [full] years will I bring back into this place all the vessels of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah [also called Coniah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, says the Lord, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who stood in the house of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The prophet Jeremiah said, Amen! May the Lord do so; may the Lord perform your words which you have prophesied to bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the Lord's house and all who were carried away captive. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Nevertheless, listen now to and hear this word which I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: 

<sup>8</sup> 

The prophets who were before me and before you from of old prophesied against many countries and against great kingdoms, of war, of evil, and of pestilence. 

<sup>9</sup> 

But as for the prophet who [on the contrary] prophesies of peace, when that prophet's word comes to pass, [only] then will it be known that the Lord has truly sent him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke bar off the prophet Jeremiah's neck and smashed it. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Hananiah said in the presence of all the people, Thus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke bars of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within the space of two [full] years. But the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet [some time] after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah: 

<sup>13</sup> 

Go, tell Hananiah, Thus says the Lord: You have broken yoke bars of wood, but you have made in their stead bars of iron. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations the iron yoke of servitude of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him. For I have given him even the beasts of the field. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Listen now, Hananiah, The Lord has not sent you, but you have made this people trust in a lie. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord: Behold, I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you will die, because you have uttered and taught rebellion against the Lord. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So Hananiah the prophet died [two months later], the same year, in the seventh month.
