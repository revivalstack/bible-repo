And Zedekiah son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of Coniah [also called Jeconiah and Jehoiachin] son of Jehoiakim. 

<sup>2</sup> 

But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to and obeyed the words of the Lord which He spoke through the prophet Jeremiah. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah with Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the Lord our God for us. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Now Jeremiah was coming in and going out among the people, for they had not [yet] put him in prison. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And Pharaoh's army had come forth out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem and departed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then came the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremiah: 

<sup>7</sup> 

Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: Behold, Pharaoh's army, which has come forth to help you, will return to Egypt, to their own land. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city, and they shall take it and burn it with fire. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Thus says the Lord: Do not deceive yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely stay away from us--for they will not stay away. 

<sup>10</sup> 

For though you should defeat the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only the wounded and men stricken through among them, every man confined to his tent, yet they would rise up and burn this city with fire. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And when the army of the Chaldeans had departed from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's approaching army, 

<sup>12</sup> 

Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin [to slip away during the brief lull in the Chaldean invasion] to receive [the title to] his portion [of land, which the Lord had promised would eventually be valuable] there among the people. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And when he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a sentry was [on guard] there, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You are deserting to the Chaldeans. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then said Jeremiah, It is false! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans. But the sentry would not listen to him. So Irijah took Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Therefore the princes were enraged with Jeremiah and beat him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe--for they had made that the prison. 

<sup>16</sup> 

When Jeremiah had come into the cells in the dungeon and had remained there many days, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Zedekiah the king sent and brought him out; and the king asked him secretly in his house, Is there any word from the Lord? And Jeremiah said, There is! And he said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, In what have I sinned against you or against your servants or against this people, that you have put me in prison? 

<sup>19</sup> 

Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you or against this land? 

<sup>20</sup> 

Therefore hear now, I pray you, O my lord the king. Let my supplication, I pray you, come before you and be acceptable, that you do not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard, and a round loaf of bread from the bakers' street was given to him daily until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained [imprisoned] in the court of the guard.
