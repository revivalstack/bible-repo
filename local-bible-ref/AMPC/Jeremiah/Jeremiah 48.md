<sup>1</sup> 

Concerning Moab: Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to [the city of] Nebo, for it is laid waste! Kiriathaim is put to shame and taken; Misgab [the high fortress] is put to shame, broken down, and crushed. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The glory of Moab is no more; in Heshbon [a border town between Reuben and Gad, east of the Jordan River] they planned evil against her, saying, Come, let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, O [town of] Madmen, shall be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

The sound of a cry from Horonaim, [a cry of] desolation and great destruction! 

<sup>4</sup> 

Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard [as far as Zoar]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For the ascent of Luhith will be climbed [by successive bands of fugitives] with continual weeping; for on the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Flee! Save your lives! But they shall be like a destitute and forsaken person in the wilderness. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For because you have trusted in your works [your bungling idol images] and in your treasures [instead of in God], you shall also be taken. And Chemosh [your god] shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the destroyer shall come upon every city; no city shall escape. The [Jordan] valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be devastated, as the Lord has said. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Give wings to Moab, for [by that means only] she will flee and get away; her cities will be desolate, without any to dwell in them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Cursed be he who does the work of the Lord negligently [with slackness, deceitfully]; and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood [in executing judgment pronounced by the Lord]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees [like wine] and has not been drawn off from one vessel to another, neither has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent has not changed. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Therefore behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I shall send to [Moab] tilters who shall tilt him up and shall empty his vessels and break his bottles (earthenware) in pieces. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh [his god], as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence. 

<sup>14</sup> 

How can you say, We are heroes and mighty men in the war? 

<sup>15</sup> 

Moab has been made desolate, and his cities have gone up [in smoke and flame]; and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, Whose name is the Lord of hosts. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The destruction of Moab is coming near, and his calamity hastens swiftly. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Bemoan him, all you [nations] who are around him, and all you [nations more remote] who know his name; say, How broken is the mighty scepter [of national power] and the splendid rod [of glory]! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Come down from your glory, you inhabitant of the Daughter of Dibon, and sit on the ground among the thirsty! For the destroyer of Moab is advancing against you; he will destroy your strongholds. 

<sup>19</sup> 

O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch! Ask him who flees and her who escapes, What has happened? 

<sup>20</sup> 

Moab is put to shame, for she is broken down. Wail and cry out! Tell by [the banks of] the Arnon that Moab is laid waste (destroyed). 

<sup>21</sup> 

Judgment has come upon the land of the plain--upon Holon and Jahzah and Mephaath, 

<sup>22</sup> 

And upon Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim, 

<sup>23</sup> 

And upon Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon, 

<sup>24</sup> 

And upon Kerioth and Bozrah--and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The horn (strength) of Moab is cut off, and his arm [of authority] is shattered, says the Lord. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Make him drunk, for he has magnified himself against the Lord [by resisting Reuben's occupation of the land the Lord had assigned him]. Moab also shall splash in his vomit, and he too shall be held in derision. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For was not Israel [an object of] derision to you? Was he found among thieves--since whenever you speak of him you wag your head [in scorn]? 

<sup>28</sup> 

O you inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities and dwell among the rocks, and be like the dove that makes her nest in the walls of the yawning ravine. 

<sup>29</sup> 

We have heard of the [giddy] pride of Moab, the extremely proud one--his loftiness, his arrogance, his conceit, and the haughtiness of his heart. 

<sup>30</sup> 

I know his insolent wrath, says the Lord, and the nothingness of his boastings and his deeds; they are false and have accomplished nothing. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Therefore I will wail over Moab, and I will cry out over the whole of Moab. Over the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth) there will be sighing and mourning. 

<sup>32</sup> 

O vines of Sibmah, I weep for you more than the weeping of Jazer [over its ruins and wasted vineyards]. Your tendrils [of influence] have gone over the sea, reaching even to Jazer. The destroyer has fallen upon your summer fruit harvest and your [season's] crop of grapes. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Joy and gladness are taken away from the fruitful orchards and fields and from the land of Moab. And I have made the juice [of the grape] to fail from what is pressed out in the vats; no one treads [the grapes] with shouting. Their shouting is no shouting [of joy, but is a battle cry]. 

<sup>34</sup> 

From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh even to Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah [like a three-year-old heifer], for even the waters of Nimrim have become desolations. 

<sup>35</sup> 

Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab, says the Lord, the one who ascends and offers in the high place and the one who burns incense to his gods. 

<sup>36</sup> 

Therefore My heart moans and sighs for Moab like flutes, and My heart moans and sighs like flutes for the men of Kir-heres (Kir-hareseth); therefore [the remnant of] the abundant riches they gained has perished. 

<sup>37</sup> 

For every head is shaven bald and every beard cut off: upon all the hands are cuts (slashes) and upon the loins is sackcloth [all to express mourning]. 

<sup>38</sup> 

On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation everywhere, for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure, says the Lord. 

<sup>39</sup> 

How it is broken down! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become [an object of] a derision and a [horrifying] terror to all who are round about him. 

<sup>40</sup> 

For thus says the Lord: Behold, he [Babylon] shall fly swiftly like an eagle and shall spread out his wings against Moab. 

<sup>41</sup> 

Kerioth [and the cities] shall be taken and the strongholds seized; and the hearts of the mighty warriors of Moab in that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs [in childbirth]. 

<sup>42</sup> 

And Moab shall be destroyed from being a nation, because he has magnified himself against the Lord. 

<sup>43</sup> 

Terror and pit and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord. 

<sup>44</sup> 

He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit, and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken and caught in the trap or snare; for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation (their inspection and infliction of punishment), says the Lord. 

<sup>45</sup> 

In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand powerless (stopped in their tracks, helpless and without strength), for a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the midst of Sihon; it has destroyed the corner of Moab and the crowns of the heads of the ones in tumult [the proud Moabites]. 

<sup>46</sup> 

Woe to you, O Moab! The people of [the god] Chemosh are undone; for your sons are taken away captive and your daughters into captivity. 

<sup>47</sup> 

Yet will I reverse the captivity and restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says the Lord. Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
