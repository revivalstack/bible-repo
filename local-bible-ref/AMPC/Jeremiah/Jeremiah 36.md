In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Take a scroll [of parchment] for a book and write on it all the words I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations from the day I spoke to you in the days of [King] Josiah until this day. 

<sup>3</sup> 

It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them, so that each one may turn from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote upon the scroll of the book all the words which Jeremiah dictated, [words] that the Lord had spoken to him. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am [in hiding, virtually] restrained and shut up; I cannot go into the house of the Lord. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Therefore you go, and on a day of fasting, in the hearing of all the people in the Lord's house, you shall read the words of the Lord which you have written on the scroll at my dictation. Also you shall read them in the hearing of all who come out of the cities of Judah. 

<sup>7</sup> 

It may be that they will make their supplication [for mercy] before the Lord, and each one will turn back from his evil way, for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And Baruch son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from [Jeremiah's] book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, a fast was proclaimed before the Lord for all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came to Jerusalem from the cities of Judah. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then Baruch read in the hearing of all the people the words of Jeremiah from the scroll of the book in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house. 

<sup>11</sup> 

When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord, 

<sup>12</sup> 

He went down to the king's house into the scribe's chamber, and behold, all the princes were sitting there: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the [other] princes. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people and come [to us]. So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And they said to him, Sit down now and read it in our hearing. So Baruch read it in their hearing. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Now when they had heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear and said to Baruch, We must surely tell the king of all these words. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And they asked Baruch, Tell us now, how did you write all these words? At [Jeremiah's] dictation? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then Baruch answered them, He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Then the princes said to Baruch, Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then they went into the court to the king, but they [first] put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; then they reported all the words to the king. 

<sup>21</sup> 

So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and of all the princes who stood beside the king. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Now it was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and a fire was burning there before him in the brazier. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And [each time] when Jehudi had read three or four columns [of the scroll], he [King Jehoiakim] would cut them off with a penknife and cast them into the fire that was in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Yet they were not afraid, nor did they rend their garments--neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Even though Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah tried to persuade the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord hid them. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at the dictation of Jeremiah, [and the Lord] said: 

<sup>28</sup> 

Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. 

<sup>29</sup> 

And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says the Lord: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon shall surely come and destroy this land and shall cut off man and beast from it? 

<sup>30</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have no [heir] to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and to the frost by night. 

<sup>31</sup> 

And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them--but they would not hear. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and besides them many similar words were added.
