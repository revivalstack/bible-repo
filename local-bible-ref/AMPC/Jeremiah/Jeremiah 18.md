The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord: 

<sup>2</sup> 

Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause you to hear My words. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he was working at the wheel. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he made it over, reworking it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to make it. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then the word of the Lord came to me: 

<sup>6</sup> 

O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel. 

<sup>7</sup> 

At one time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it; 

<sup>8</sup> 

And if [the people of] that nation concerning which I have spoken turn from their evil, I will relent and reverse My decision concerning the evil that I thought to do to them. 

<sup>9</sup> 

At another time I will suddenly speak concerning a nation or kingdom, that I will build up and plant it; 

<sup>10</sup> 

And if they do evil in My sight, obeying not My voice, then I will regret and reverse My decision concerning the good with which I said I would benefit them. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Now therefore say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you. Return now each one from his evil way; reform your [accustomed] ways and make your [individual] actions good and right. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But they will say, That is in vain! For we will walk after our own devices, and we will each do as the stubbornness of his own evil heart dictates. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord: Ask now among the nations: Who has heard such things? Virgin Israel has done a very vile and horrible thing. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Will the snow of Mount Lebanon fail and vanish from its rocks [which tower above the land of Israel]? Will the cold, rushing waters of strange lands [that dash down from afar] be dried up? 

<sup>15</sup> 

Yet My people have forgotten Me; they burn incense to false gods, they have been caused to stumble in their ways and in the ancient roads, to walk in bypaths, in a way not graded and built up [not on a highway], 

<sup>16</sup> 

Making their land a desolation and a horror, a thing to be hissed at perpetually; everyone who passes by shall be astounded and horrified and shake his head. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity [says the Lord]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then [my enemies] said, Come and let us devise schemes against Jeremiah; for the law [of Moses] shall not perish from the priest [as this false prophet Jeremiah predicts], nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue [making a charge against him to the king], and let us not pay any attention to his words. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Give heed to me, Lord; listen to [what] my adversaries [are plotting to do to me--and intercede]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Shall evil be recompensed for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life. [Earnestly] remember that I stood before You to speak good for them, to turn away Your anger from them. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Therefore deliver up their children to the famine; give them over to the power of the sword. And let their wives become childless and widows; let their men meet death by pestilence, their young men be slain by the sword in battle. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring a troop upon them, for they have dug a pit to take me and have hidden snares for my feet. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Yet, Lord, You know all their plotting against me to slay me. Forgive not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from Your sight. But let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
