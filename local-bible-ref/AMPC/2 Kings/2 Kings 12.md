In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zibiah of Beersheba. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Joash did right in the sight of the Lord all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Yet the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And Joash said to the priests, All the current money brought into the house of the Lord to provide the dedicated things, also the money [which the priests by command have] assessed on all those bound by vows, also all the money that it comes into any man's heart voluntarily to bring into the house of the Lord, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let the priests solicit and receive such contributions, every man from his acquaintance, and let them repair the Lord's house wherever any such need may be found. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But in the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign the priests had not made the needed repairs on the Lord's house. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, Why are you not repairing the [Lord's] house? Do not take any more money from your acquaintances, but turn it all over for the repair of the house. [You are no longer responsible for this work. I will take it into my own hands.] 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the priests consented to receive no more money from the people, nor to repair the breaches of the house. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the house of the Lord; and the priests who guarded the door put in the chest all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came up and counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord and tied it up in bags. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Then they gave the money, when it was weighed, into the hands of those who were doing the work, who had the oversight of the house of the Lord; and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the Lord 

<sup>12</sup> 

And to the masons and stonecutters, and to buy timber and hewn stone for making the repairs on the house of the Lord, and for all that was outlay for repairing the house. 

<sup>13</sup> 

However, there were not made for the house of the Lord basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, any vessels of gold or of silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired with it the house of the Lord. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hands they delivered the money to be paid to the workmen, for they dealt faithfully. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the house of the Lord; it was the priests'. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then Hazael king of Syria went up, fought against Gath [in Philistia], and took it. And Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And Joash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his [forefathers], kings of Judah, had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and in the king's house, and sent them to Hazael king of Syria; and Hazael went away from Jerusalem. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 

<sup>20</sup> 

His servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew Joash [in revenge] in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla. 

<sup>21</sup> 

It was Jozachar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer, his servants, who smote him so that he died. They buried [Joash] with his fathers in the City of David. Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
