Ahab had seventy [grandsons] in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them from Jezreel to the rulers of Samaria, to the elders, and to those who brought up Ahab's [grandsons], saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master [Joram's] sons are with you and also chariots and horses, a fortified city, and weapons, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Select the best and most fit of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne; and fight for your master's house. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But they were exceedingly afraid and reasoned, The two kings could not stand before [Jehu]; how then can we stand? 

<sup>5</sup> 

And he who was over the household, he who was over the city, the elders also, and the guardians and tutors sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants and will do all that you bid us; [but] we will not make any man king; do what is good in your eyes. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then [Jehu] wrote a second letter to them, saying, If you are with me and will obey me, take the heads of your master [Joram's] sons and come to me at Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the [dead] king's sons, seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who were bringing them up. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When the letter came to these men, they took the king's sons and slew them, seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 

<sup>8</sup> 

When a messenger came and told him, They have brought the heads of the king's sons, he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The next morning he went out and stood and said to all the people, You are just and innocent. Behold, I conspired against my master and slew him, but who smote all these? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Know now that nothing which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab shall be unfulfilled or ineffective; for the Lord has done what He said through His servant Elijah. 

<sup>11</sup> 

So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, his familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And he arose and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house of the shepherds on the way, 

<sup>13</sup> 

Jehu met the kinsmen of Ahaziah king of Judah and said, Who are you? They answered, We are the kinsmen of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of [Jezebel] the queen mother. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He said, Take them alive. And they did so and slew them at the cistern of the shearing house, forty-two men; he left none of them. 

<sup>15</sup> 

When Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Rechab coming to meet him. He saluted him and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours? Jehonadab answered, It is. [Jehu said] If it is, give me your hand. He gave him his hand, and Jehu took him up into the chariot. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And he said, Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord. So they made [the Rechabite] ride in Jehu's chariot. 

<sup>17</sup> 

When Jehu came to Samaria, he slew all who remained of Ahab's family in Samaria, till he had destroyed them all, according to what the Lord said to Elijah. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests. Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to make to Baal; whoever is missing shall not live. But Jehu did it with trickery, intending to destroy the Baal worshipers. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Jehu sent through all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came; not a man failed to come. They went to the house or temple of Baal, filling it from one end to the other. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And he said to the man over the vestry, Bring vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them vestments. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Then Jehu with Jehonadab son of Rechab went into the house of Baal and said to the worshipers of Baal, Search and see that there are here with you none of the servants of the Lord--but Baal worshipers only. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed eighty men outside and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he who lets him go shall forfeit his own life for his life. 

<sup>25</sup> 

As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and to the officers, Go in and slay them; let none escape. And they smote them with the sword; and the guards or runners [before the king] and the officers threw their bodies out and went into the inner dwelling of the house of Baal. 

<sup>26</sup> 

They brought out the pillars or obelisks of the house of Baal and burned them. 

<sup>27</sup> 

They broke down the pillars of Baal and the house of Baal, and made it [forever unclean] a privy to this day. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Thus Jehu rooted Baal out of Israel. 

<sup>29</sup> 

But Jehu did not give up the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, by which he made Israel to sin, that is, the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And the Lord said to Jehu, Because you have executed well what is right in My eyes and have done to the house of Ahab as I willed, your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on Israel's throne. [Fulfilled in II Kings 15:12.] 

<sup>31</sup> 

But Jehu paid no attention to walking in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not quit the sins with which Jeroboam made Israel to sin. 

<sup>32</sup> 

[So] in those days the Lord began to cut off parts of Israel. Hazael [of Syria] defeated them in all the [across the Jordan] territory of Israel 

<sup>33</sup> 

From the Jordan east, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, Reubenites, and Manassites, from Aroer which is by the Valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. 

<sup>34</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 

<sup>35</sup> 

Jehu slept with his fathers. They buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 

<sup>36</sup> 

The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
