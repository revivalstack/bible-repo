<sup>1</sup> 

In his days, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him. 

<sup>2</sup> 

The Lord sent against Jehoiakim bands of Chaldeans, of Syrians, of Moabites, and of Ammonites. And He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servants the prophets. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Surely this came upon Judah at the command of the Lord, to remove them out of His sight because of the sins of Manasseh according to all he had done, 

<sup>4</sup> 

And also for the innocent blood that he shed. For he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord would not pardon. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Judah's Kings? 

<sup>6</sup> 

So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers. Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The king of Egypt came no more out of his land, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to Egypt's king, from the River of Egypt to the river Euphrates. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began his three-month reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, in keeping with all his father had done. 

<sup>10</sup> 

At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon, he, his mother, his servants, princes, and palace officials. The king of Babylon took him prisoner in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He carried off all the treasures of the Lord's house and the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold in the temple of the Lord, which Solomon king of Israel had made, as the Lord had said. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He carried away all Jerusalem, all the princes, all the mighty men of valor, 10,000 captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths. None remained except the poorest of the land. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Nebuchadnezzar took captive to Babylon King Jehoiachin; his mother, his wives, his officials, and the chief and mighty men of the land [the prophet Ezekiel included] he took from Jerusalem to Babylon into exile. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon all the men of valor, 7,000, and craftsmen and smiths, 1,000, all strong and fit for war. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his stead and changed his name to Zedekiah. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his eleven-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He did evil in the sight of the Lord, in keeping with all Jehoiakim had done. 

<sup>20</sup> 

For because of the anger of the Lord it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that He cast them out of His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
