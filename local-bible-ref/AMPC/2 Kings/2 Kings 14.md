<sup>1</sup> 

In the second year of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah reigned. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He was twenty-five years old when he began his twenty-nine-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He did right in the sight of the Lord, yet not like David his [forefather]. He did all things as Joash his father did. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. 

<sup>5</sup> 

As soon as the kingdom was established in Amaziah's hand, he slew his servants who had slain the king his father. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But he did not slay the children of the murderers, in compliance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, in which the Lord commanded, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin only. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Amaziah slew of Edom in the Valley of Salt 10,000, and took Sela (Greek petra [rock]) by war, and called it Joktheel, which is the name of it to this day. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face and test each other. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah, The thistle in Lebanon sent to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife. And a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle [leaving the cedar unharmed]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Glory in that, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your hurt and provoke calamity, causing you to fall, you and Judah with you? 

<sup>11</sup> 

But Amaziah would not hear. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah measured swords at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled home. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate, 400 cubits. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He seized all the gold and silver and all the vessels found in the Lord's house and in the treasuries of the king's house, also hostages, and returned to Samaria. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Jehoash, his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of Israel's Kings? 

<sup>16</sup> 

Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with Israel's kings. Jeroboam [II] reigned in his stead. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? 

<sup>19</sup> 

Now a conspiracy was made against him in Jerusalem, and Amaziah fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish and slew him there. 

<sup>20</sup> 

They brought him on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And all the people of Judah took Azariah, sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. 

<sup>22</sup> 

He built Elath and restored it to Judah after the king [his father] died. 

<sup>23</sup> 

In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam [II] son of Jehoash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty-one years. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He did evil in the sight of the Lord; he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam [I] son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Jeroboam restored Israel's border from the entrance of Hamath to the [Dead] Sea of the Arabah, according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which He spoke through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher. 

<sup>26</sup> 

For the Lord saw as very bitter the affliction of Israel; there was no one left, bond or free, nor any helper for Israel. 

<sup>27</sup> 

But the Lord had not said that He would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens, so He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam [II] son of Jehoash. 

<sup>28</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Jeroboam [II], all that he did, his might, how he warred, and how he recovered for Israel Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 

<sup>29</sup> 

Jeroboam [II] slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel. Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.
