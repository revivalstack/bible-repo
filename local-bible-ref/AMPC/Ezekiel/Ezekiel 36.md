<sup>1</sup> 

Also you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy has said over you, Aha! and, The ancient heights have become our possession, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Therefore prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord God: Because, yes, because they made you a desolation, and they snapped after and crushed you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people, 

<sup>4</sup> 

Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate wastes and the cities that are forsaken, that have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations that are round about; 

<sup>5</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord God: Surely in the fire of My hot jealousy have I spoken against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who have given to themselves My land with wholehearted joy and with uttermost contempt, that they might empty it out and possess it for a prey and a spoil. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have suffered the shame and reproach of the nations; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord God: I have lifted up My hand and sworn, Surely the nations that are round about you shall themselves suffer shame and reproach. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are soon to come [home]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

For behold, I am for you and I will turn to you; and you shall be tilled and sown, 

<sup>10</sup> 

And I will multiply men upon you, the whole house of Israel, even all of it; the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places shall be rebuilt, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited according to your former estate and I will do better for you than at your beginnings; and you shall know, understand, and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler, Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Yes, [O mountains of Israel] I will cause men to walk upon you, even My people Israel, and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance; and you shall no more after this bereave them of children [for idol sacrifices]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Thus says the Lord God: Because they say to you, You [O land] are a devourer of men and have bereaved your nation of children [offered to idols], 

<sup>14</sup> 

Therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your nation or cause it to stumble any more, says the Lord God. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Neither will I let you hear any more the reproach of the nations, nor shall you suffer the dishonor of the peoples any more, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble and fall any more [through idolatry], says the Lord God. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by [doing] their [own] way and by their [idolatrous] doings. Their conduct before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman during her [physical] impurity. 

<sup>18</sup> 

So I poured out My wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols with which they had defiled it. 

<sup>19</sup> 

And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their conduct and their [idolatrous] deeds I judged and punished them. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And when they came to the nations to which they went, they profaned My holy name in that men said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and yet they had to go forth out of His land. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But I had regard, concern, and compassion for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they went. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: I do not do this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for My holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations to which you went. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And I will vindicate the holiness of My great name and separate it for its holy purpose from all that defiles it--My name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them--and the nations will know, understand, and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler, Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service], when I shall be set apart by you and My holiness vindicated in you before their eyes and yours. 

<sup>24</sup> 

For I will take you from among the nations and gather you out of all countries and bring you into your own land. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness; and from all your idols will I cleanse you. 

<sup>26</sup> 

A new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 

<sup>27</sup> 

And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall heed My ordinances and do them. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and you shall be My people, and I will be your God. 

<sup>29</sup> 

I will also save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will call forth the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine on you. 

<sup>30</sup> 

And I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field, that you may no more suffer the reproach and disgrace of famine among the nations. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Then you shall [earnestly] remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominable deeds. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Not for your sake do I do this, says the Lord God; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your [own] wicked ways, O house of Israel! 

<sup>33</sup> 

Thus says the Lord God: In the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities I will [also] cause [Israel's] cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt. 

<sup>34</sup> 

And the desolate land shall be tilled, that which had lain desolate in the sight of all who passed by. 

<sup>35</sup> 

And they shall say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. 

<sup>36</sup> 

Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I the Lord have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it. 

<sup>37</sup> 

Thus says the Lord God: For this also I will let the house of Israel inquire of Me to do it for them; I will increase their men like a flock. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Like the flock of holy things for sacrifice, like the flock of Jerusalem in her [solemn] appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know, understand, and realize that I am the Lord [the Sovereign Ruler, Who calls forth loyalty and obedient service].
