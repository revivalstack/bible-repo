Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the East Gate of the Lord's house, which faces east. And behold, at the door of the gateway there were twenty-five men; and I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then [the Spirit] said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Who say, [The time] is not near to build houses; this city is the boiling pot and we are the flesh. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man! 

<sup>5</sup> 

And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and He said to me, Speak. Say, Thus says the Lord: This is what you thought, O house of Israel, for I know the things that come into your mind. 

<sup>6</sup> 

You have multiplied your slain in this city and you have filled its streets with the slain. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord God: Your slain whom you have laid in your midst; they are the flesh and this city is the boiling pot, but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

You have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord God. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it and deliver you into the hands of foreigners and execute judgments among you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

You shall fall by the sword; I will judge and punish you [before your neighbors] at the border or outside the land of Israel, and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord. 

<sup>11</sup> 

This city shall not be your boiling pot, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border or outside of Israel; 

<sup>12</sup> 

And you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations around you. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And while I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice, Ah, Lord God! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel? 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Son of man, your brethren, even your kindred, your fellow exiles, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are they of whom the [present] inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, They have gone far from the Lord [and from this land]; therefore this land is given to us for a possession. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God: Whereas I have removed [Israel] far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet I have been to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries to which they have come. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give back to you the land of Israel. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And when they return there, they shall take away from it all traces of its detestable things and all its abominations (sex impurities and heathen religious practices). 

<sup>19</sup> 

And I will give them one heart [a new heart] and I will put a new spirit within them; and I will take the stony [unnaturally hardened] heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh [sensitive and responsive to the touch of their God], 

<sup>20</sup> 

That they may walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances, and do them. And they shall be My people, and I will be their God. 

<sup>21</sup> 

But as for those whose heart yearns for and goes after their detestable things and their loathsome abominations [associated with idolatry], I will repay their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord God. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then the cherubim lifted up their wings with the wheels which were beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel [the Shekinah, cloud] was over them. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Then the glory of the Lord rose up from over the midst of the city and stood over the mountain which is on the east side of the city. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And I told the exiles everything that the Lord had shown me.
