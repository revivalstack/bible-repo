<sup>1</sup> 

And in the sixth year [of the capitivity of King Jehoiachin], in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house [a captive of the Babylonians] with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then I beheld, and lo, a likeness of a Man with the appearance of fire; from His waist downward He was like fire, and from His waist upward He had the appearance of brightness like gleaming bronze. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And He put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the door of the inner [court] which faces toward the north, where was the seat of the idol (image) of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And behold, there was the glory of the God of Israel [Who had loved and chosen them], like the vision I saw in the plain. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Then He [the Spirit] said to me, Son of man, now lift up your eyes toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, on the north of the altar gate was that idol (image) of jealousy in the entrance. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Furthermore, [the Spirit] said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? The great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here to drive Me far from My sanctuary? But you shall again see greater abominations. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then He said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall. And when I had dug in the wall, behold, there was a door. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And He said to me, Go in and see the wicked abominations that they do here. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So I went in and saw there pictures of every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel, painted round about on the wall. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And there stood before these [pictures] seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan [the scribe], with every man his censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense was going up [in prayer to these their gods]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Then said He to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his [secret] chambers of [idol] pictures? For they say, The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He also said to me, Yet again you shall see greater abominations which they are committing. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Lord's house; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz [a Babylonian god, who was supposed to die annually and subsequently be resurrected]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then said [the Spirit] to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Yet again you shall see greater abominations that they are committing. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And He brought me to the inner court of the Lord's house; and behold, at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the bronze altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing themselves toward the east and worshiping the sun. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Then [the Spirit] said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too slight a thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here, that they must fill the land with violence and turn back afresh to provoke Me to anger? And behold, they put the branch to their nose [actually, before their mouths, in superstitious worship]! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Therefore I will deal in wrath; My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.
