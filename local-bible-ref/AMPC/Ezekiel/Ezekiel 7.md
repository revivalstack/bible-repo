<sup>1</sup> 

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Also, son of man, thus says the Lord God to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Now is the end upon you, and I will send My anger upon you and will judge you according to your ways and will bring upon you retribution for all your abominations. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And My eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring recompense for your evil ways upon you, while your abominations are in the midst of you [calling down punishment from a righteous God]; and you shall know (recognize, understand, and realize) that I am the Lord. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Thus says the Lord God: Behold, an evil is coming, [an evil so destructive and injurious, so sudden and violent, that it stands alone, not as a succession but as] only one evil. 

<sup>6</sup> 

An end has come! The end has come! [The end--after sleeping so long] awakes against you. See, it has come! 

<sup>7</sup> 

Your turn (your doom) has come upon you, O inhabitant of the land; the time has come, the day is near, a day not of joyful shouting, but a day of tumult upon the mountains. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Now will I shortly pour out My wrath upon you and finish spending My anger against you, and I will judge you according to your ways and will recompense you with punishment for all your abominations. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. I will punish you according to your ways while your abominations are right in the midst of you. And you shall know, understand, and realize that it is I the Lord Who smites you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Your doom has gone forth, the rod has blossomed, pride has budded. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness; none of [Israel] shall remain, none of their abundance, none of their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them or wailing for them. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, even were they yet alive. For the vision [of punishment] is touching [Israel's] whole multitude; he shall not come back, neither shall any strengthen himself whose life is in his iniquity. 

<sup>14</sup> 

They have blown the trumpet and have made all ready, but none goes to the battle, for My wrath is upon all their multitude. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The sword is without and pestilence and famine are within. He who is in the field shall die by the sword, and him who is in the city shall famine and pestilence devour. 

<sup>16</sup> 

But those of them that escape shall escape, but shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity's [punishment]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

All hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water. 

<sup>18</sup> 

They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth; horror and dismay shall cover them, and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads [as evidence of grief]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be [discarded] like an unclean thing or rubbish; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their animal cravings nor fill their stomachs with them, for [wealth] has been the stumbling block of their iniquity. 

<sup>20</sup> 

As for the beauty of gold for ornament, they turned it to pride and made of it the images of their abominations (idols) and of their detestable things. Therefore I will make it to them as an unclean thing. 

<sup>21</sup> 

And I will give it for plunder into the hands of strangers and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, and they shall profane it. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Also I will turn My face from them and they shall profane My secret treasure [the temple]; and robbers shall enter into it and profane it. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Prepare the chain [of imprisonment], for the land is full of bloodguiltiness [murders committed with pretended formalities of justice] and the city is full of violence. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Therefore I will bring in the worst of the [heathen] nations, who will take possession of the houses [of the people of Judah]; I will also silence their strongholds and put an end to their proud might, and their holy places and those who sanctify them shall be profaned. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Distress, panic, and destruction shall come, and they [of Judah] shall seek peace, and there shall be none. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Calamity shall come upon calamity and rumor shall be upon rumor, and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; and the law and instruction shall cease from the [distracted] priest and counsel from the [dismayed] elders. 

<sup>27</sup> 

The king [of Judah] shall wear mourning and the prince shall clothe himself with garments of despair and desolation, while the hands of the people of the land shall tremble [palsied by terror]; for I will do to them in accordance with their ways, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know, recognize, and realize that I am the Lord.
