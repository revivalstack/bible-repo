And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Son of man, How is the wood of the grapevine [Israel] more than that of any tree, the vine branch which was among the trees of the forest? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Shall wood be taken from it to do any work? Or will men take a peg of it on which to hang any vessel? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire consumes both ends of it and the middle of it is charred. Is it suitable or profitable for any work? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Notice, even when it was whole, it was good for no work; how much less shall it be useful and profitable when the fire has devoured it and it is charred? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the grapevine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And I will set My face against them; they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them, and you shall know (understand and realize) that I am the Lord, when I set My face against them. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And I will make the land desolate (laid waste and deserted) because they have acted faithlessly [through their idolatry], says the Lord.
