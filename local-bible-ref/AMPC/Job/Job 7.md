<sup>1</sup> 

Is there not an [appointed] warfare and hard labor to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling? 

<sup>2</sup> 

As a servant earnestly longs for the shade and the evening shadows, and as a hireling who looks for the reward of his work, 

<sup>3</sup> 

So am I allotted months of futile [suffering], and [long] nights of misery are appointed to me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

When I lie down I say, When shall I arise and the night be gone? And I am full of tossing to and fro till the dawning of the day. 

<sup>5</sup> 

My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and has become loathsome, and it closes up and breaks out afresh. 

<sup>6</sup> 

My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Oh, remember that my life is but wind (a puff, a breath, a sob); my eye shall see good no more. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I shall be gone. 

<sup>9</sup> 

As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol (the place of the dead) shall come up no more. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul [O Lord]! 

<sup>12</sup> 

Am I the sea, or the sea monster, that You set a watch over me? 

<sup>13</sup> 

When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Then You scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions, 

<sup>15</sup> 

So that I would choose strangling and death rather than these my bones. 

<sup>16</sup> 

I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone, for my days are a breath (futility). 

<sup>17</sup> 

What is man that You should magnify him and think him important? And that You should set Your mind upon him? 

<sup>18</sup> 

And that You should visit him every morning and try him every moment? 

<sup>19</sup> 

How long will Your [plaguing] glance not look away from me, nor You let me alone till I swallow my spittle? 

<sup>20</sup> 

If I have sinned, what [harm] have I done You, O You Watcher and Keeper of men? Why have You set me as a mark for You, so that I am a burden to myself [and You]? 

<sup>21</sup> 

And why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; and [even if] You will seek me diligently, [it will be too late, for] I shall not be.
