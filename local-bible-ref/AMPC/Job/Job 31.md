<sup>1</sup> 

I dictated a covenant (an agreement) to my eyes; how then could I look [lustfully] upon a girl? 

<sup>2</sup> 

For what portion should I have from God above [if I were lewd], and what heritage from the Almighty on high? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Does not calamity [justly] befall the unrighteous, and disaster the workers of iniquity? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Does not [God] see my ways and count all my steps? 

<sup>5</sup> 

If I have walked with falsehood or vanity, or if my foot has hastened to deceit-- 

<sup>6</sup> 

Oh, let me be weighed in a just balance and let Him weigh me, that God may know my integrity! 

<sup>7</sup> 

If my step has turned out of [God's] way, and my heart has gone the way my eyes [covetously] invited, and if any spot has stained my hands with guilt, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then let me sow and let another eat; yes, let the produce of my field or my offspring be rooted out. 

<sup>9</sup> 

If my heart has been deceived and I made a fool by a woman, or if I have [covetously] laid wait at my neighbor's door [until his departure], 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then let my wife grind [meal, like a bondslave] for another, and let others bow down upon her. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For [adultery] is a heinous and chief crime, an iniquity [to demand action by] the judges and punishment. 

<sup>12</sup> 

For [uncontrolled passion] is a fire which consumes to Abaddon (to destruction, ruin, and the place of final torment); [that fire once lighted would rage until all is consumed] and would burn to the root all my [life's] increase. 

<sup>13</sup> 

If I have despised and rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they contended or brought a complaint against me, 

<sup>14</sup> 

What then shall I do when God rises up [to judge]? When He visits [to inquire of me], what shall I answer Him? 

<sup>15</sup> 

Did not He Who made me in the womb make [my servant]? And did not One fashion us both in the womb? 

<sup>16</sup> 

If I have withheld from the poor and needy what they desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to look in vain [for relief], 

<sup>17</sup> 

Or have eaten my morsel alone and have not shared it with the fatherless-- 

<sup>18</sup> 

No, but from my youth [the fatherless] grew up with me as a father, and I have been [the widow's] guide from my mother's womb-- 

<sup>19</sup> 

If I have seen anyone perish for want of clothing, or any poor person without covering, 

<sup>20</sup> 

If his loins have not blessed me [for clothing them], and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 

<sup>21</sup> 

If I have lifted my hand against the fatherless when I saw [that the judges would be favorable and be] my help at the [council] gate, 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then let my shoulder fall away from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its socket. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For calamity from God was a terror to me, and because of His majesty I could not endure [to face Him] and could do nothing. 

<sup>24</sup> 

If I have made gold my trust and hope or have said to fine gold, You are my confidence, 

<sup>25</sup> 

If I rejoiced because my wealth was great and because my [powerful] hand [alone] had gotten much, 

<sup>26</sup> 

If I beheld [as an object of worship] the sunlight when it shone or the moon walking in its brightness, 

<sup>27</sup> 

And my heart has been secretly enticed by them or my mouth has kissed my hand [in homage to them], 

<sup>28</sup> 

This also would have been [a heinous and principal] iniquity to demand the judges' action and punishment, for I would have denied and been false to the God Who is above. 

<sup>29</sup> 

If I rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me or lifted myself up [in malicious triumph] when evil overtook him-- 

<sup>30</sup> 

No, I have let my mouth sin neither by cursing my enemy nor by praying that he might die-- 

<sup>31</sup> 

[Just ask] if the men of my tent will not say, Who can find one in need who has not been satisfied with food he gave them?-- 

<sup>32</sup> 

The temporary resident has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my door to the wayfaring man-- 

<sup>33</sup> 

If like Adam or like [other] men I have concealed my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom 

<sup>34</sup> 

Because I feared the great multitude and the contempt of families terrified me so that I kept silence and did not go out of the door-- 

<sup>35</sup> 

Oh, for a hearing! Oh, for an answer from the Almighty! Let my adversary write out His indictment [and put His vague accusations in tangible form] in a book! 

<sup>36</sup> 

Surely I would [proudly] bear it on my shoulder and wind the scroll about my head as a diadem. 

<sup>37</sup> 

I would count out to Him the number of my steps [with every detail of my life], approaching His presence as a prince-- 

<sup>38</sup> 

For if my land has cried out against me and its furrows have complained together with tears [that I have no right to them], 

<sup>39</sup> 

If I have eaten its fruits without paying for them or have caused its [rightful] owners to breathe their last, 

<sup>40</sup> 

Let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockleburs instead of barley. The [controversial] words of Job [with his friends] are ended.
