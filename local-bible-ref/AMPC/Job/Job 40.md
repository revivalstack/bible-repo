Moreover, the Lord said to Job, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Shall he who would find fault with the Almighty contend with Him? He who disputes with God, let him answer it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Then Job replied to the Lord: 

<sup>4</sup> 

Behold, I am of small account and vile! What shall I answer You? I lay my hand upon my mouth. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I have spoken once, but I will not reply again--indeed, twice [have I answered], but I will proceed no further. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, saying, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Gird up your loins now like a man; I will demand of you, and you answer Me. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Will you also annul (set aside and render void) My judgment? Will you condemn Me [your God], that you may [appear] righteous and justified? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Have you an arm like God? Or can you thunder with a voice like His? 

<sup>10</sup> 

[Since you question the manner of the Almighty's rule] deck yourself now with the excellency and dignity [of the Supreme Ruler, and yourself undertake the government of the world if you are so wise], and array yourself with honor and majesty. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Pour forth the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him; 

<sup>12</sup> 

Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low, and tread down the wicked where they stand [if you are so able, Job]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

[Bury and] hide them all in the dust together; [and] shut them up [in the prison house of death]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

[If you can do all this, Job, proving yourself of divine might] then will I [God] praise you also [and acknowledge that] your own right hand can save you. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Behold now the behemoth (the hippopotamus), which I created as I did you; he eats grass like an ox. 

<sup>16</sup> 

See now, his strength is in his loins, and his power is in the sinews of his belly. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He moves his tail like a cedar tree; the tendons of his thighs are twisted together [like a rope]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

His bones are like tubes of bronze; his limbs [or ribs] are like bars of iron. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[The hippopotamus] is the first [in magnitude and power] of the works of God [in animal life]; [only] He Who made him provides him with his [swordlike tusks, or only God Who made him can bring near His sword to master him]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Surely the mountains bring him food, where all the wild animals play. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reeds in the marsh. 

<sup>22</sup> 

The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook compass him about. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Behold, if a river is violent and overflows, he does not tremble; he is confident, though the Jordan [River] swells and rushes against his mouth. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Can any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?
