Elihu answered (continued his discourse) and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who have [so much] knowledge. 

<sup>3</sup> 

For the ear tries words as the palate tastes food. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Let us choose for ourselves that which is right; let us know among ourselves what is good. 

<sup>5</sup> 

For Job has said, I am [innocent and uncompromisingly] righteous, but God has taken away my right; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Would I lie against my right? Yet, notwithstanding my right, I am counted a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression. 

<sup>7</sup> 

What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing and scorning like water, 

<sup>8</sup> 

Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity and walks with wicked men? 

<sup>9</sup> 

For he has said, It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God and consent to Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Therefore hear me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God that He should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that He should commit iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For according to the deeds of a man God will [exactly] proportion his pay, and He will cause every man to find [recompense] according to his ways. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Truly God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Who put [God] in charge over the earth? Or who laid on Him the whole world? 

<sup>14</sup> 

If [God] should set His heart upon him [man] and withdraw His [life-giving] spirit and His breath [from man] to Himself, 

<sup>15</sup> 

All flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 

<sup>16</sup> 

If now you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Is it possible that an enemy of right should govern? And will you condemn Him Who is just and mighty? 

<sup>18</sup> 

[God] Who says to a king, You are worthless and vile, or to princes and nobles, You are ungodly and evil? 

<sup>19</sup> 

[God] is not partial to princes, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of His hands. 

<sup>20</sup> 

In a moment they die; even at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no [human] hand. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For [God's] eyes are upon the ways of a man, and He sees all his steps. 

<sup>22</sup> 

There is no darkness nor thick gloom where the evildoers may hide themselves. 

<sup>23</sup> 

[God] sets before man no appointed time, that he should appear before [Him] in judgment. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry [before a jury] and in ways past finding out and sets others in their stead. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Therefore He takes knowledge of their works, and He overturns them in the night, so that they are crushed and destroyed. 

<sup>26</sup> 

God strikes them down as wicked men in the open sight of beholders, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Because they turned aside from Him and would not consider or show regard for any of His ways, 

<sup>28</sup> 

So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him, and He heard the cry of the afflicted. 

<sup>29</sup> 

When He gives quietness (peace and security from oppression), who then can condemn? When He hides His face [withdrawing His favor and help], who then can behold Him [and make Him gracious], whether it be a nation or a man by himself?-- 

<sup>30</sup> 

That the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For has anyone said to God, I have borne my chastisement; I will not offend any more; 

<sup>32</sup> 

Teach me what I do not see [in regard to how I have sinned]; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more? 

<sup>33</sup> 

Should [God's] recompense [for your sins] be as you will it, when you refuse to accept it? For you must do the choosing, and not I; therefore say what is your truthful conclusion. 

<sup>34</sup> 

Men of understanding will tell me, indeed, every wise man who hears me [will agree], 

<sup>35</sup> 

That Job speaks without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom and insight. 

<sup>36</sup> 

[Would that Job's afflictions be continued and] he be tried to the end because of his answering like wicked men! 

<sup>37</sup> 

For he adds rebellion [in his unsubmissive, defiant attitude toward God] to his unacknowledged sin; he claps his hands [in open mockery and contempt of God] among us, and he multiplies his words of accusation against God.
