Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

If we venture to converse with you, will you be offended? Yet who can restrain himself from speaking? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Your words have held firm him who was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But now it is come upon you, and you faint and are grieved; it touches you, and you are troubled and dismayed. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Is not your [reverent] fear of God your confidence and the integrity and uprightness of your ways your hope? 

<sup>7</sup> 

Think [earnestly], I beg of you: who, being innocent, ever perished? Or where were those upright and in right standing with God cut off? 

<sup>8</sup> 

As I myself have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble and mischief reap the same. 

<sup>9</sup> 

By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken. 

<sup>11</sup> 

The old and strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a whisper of it. 

<sup>13</sup> 

In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up! 

<sup>16</sup> 

[The spirit] stood still, but I could not discern the appearance of it. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, and then I heard a voice, saying, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Can mortal man be just before God, or be more right than He is? Can a man be pure before his Maker, or be more cleansed than He is? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Even in His [heavenly] servants He puts no trust or confidence, and His angels He charges with folly and error-- 

<sup>19</sup> 

How much more those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Between morning and evening they are destroyed; without anyone noticing it they perish forever. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Is not their tent cord plucked up within them [so that the tent falls]? Do they not die, and that without [acquiring] wisdom?
