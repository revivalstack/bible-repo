<sup>1</sup> 

There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who [reverently] feared God and abstained from and shunned evil [because it was wrong]. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 

<sup>3</sup> 

He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very great body of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East. 

<sup>4</sup> 

His sons used to go and feast in the house of each on his day (birthday) in turn, and they invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And when the days of their feasting were over, Job sent for them to purify and hallow them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed or disowned God in their hearts. Thus did Job at all [such] times. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Now there was a day when the sons (the angels) of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and accuser) also came among them. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan, From where did you come? Then Satan answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns evil [because it is wrong]? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then Satan answered the Lord, Does Job [reverently] fear God for nothing? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Have You not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have conferred prosperity and happiness upon him in the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 

<sup>11</sup> 

But put forth Your hand now and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan (the adversary and the accuser), Behold, all that he has is in your power, only upon the man himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. 

<sup>13</sup> 

And there was a day when [Job's] sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house [on his birthday], 

<sup>14</sup> 

And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, 

<sup>15</sup> 

And the Sabeans swooped down upon them and took away [the animals]. Indeed, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. 

<sup>16</sup> 

While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The fire of God (lightning) has fallen from the heavens and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you. 

<sup>17</sup> 

While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, The Chaldeans divided into three bands and made a raid upon the camels and have taken them away, yes, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, 

<sup>19</sup> 

And behold, there came a great [whirlwind] from the desert, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Then Job arose and rent his robe and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshiped 

<sup>21</sup> 

And said, Naked (without possessions) came I [into this world] from my mother's womb, and naked (without possessions) shall I depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed (praised and magnified in worship) be the name of the Lord! 

<sup>22</sup> 

In all this Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly.
