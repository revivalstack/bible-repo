<sup>1</sup> 

But now they who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Yes, how could the strength of their hands profit me? They were men whose ripe age and vigor had perished. 

<sup>3</sup> 

They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry and barren ground or flee into the wilderness, into the gloom of wasteness and desolation. 

<sup>4</sup> 

They pluck saltwort or mallows among the bushes, and roots of the broom for their food or to warm them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

They are driven from among men, who shout after them as after a thief. 

<sup>6</sup> 

They must dwell in the clefts of frightful valleys (gullies made by torrents) and in holes of the earth and of the rocks. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Among the bushes they bray and howl [like wild animals]; beneath the prickly scrub they fling themselves and huddle together. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Sons of the worthless and nameless, they have been scourged and crushed out of the land. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And now I have become their song; yes, I am a byword to them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and do not refrain from spitting in my face or at the sight of me. 

<sup>11</sup> 

For God has loosed my bowstring and afflicted and humbled me; they have cast off the bridle [of restraint] before me. 

<sup>12</sup> 

On my right hand rises the rabble brood; they jostle me and push away my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction [like an advancing army]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

They break up and clutter my path [embarrassing my plans]; they urge on my calamity, even though they have no helper [and are themselves helpless]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

As through a wide breach they come in; amid the crash [of falling walls] they roll themselves upon me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Terrors are turned upon me; my honor and reputation they chase away like the wind, and my welfare has passed away as a cloud. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And now my life is poured out within me; the days of affliction have gripped me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

My bones are pierced [with aching] in the night season, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest. 

<sup>18</sup> 

By the great force [of my disease] my garment is disguised and disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my coat. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[God] has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes. 

<sup>20</sup> 

I cry to You, [Lord,] and You do not answer me; I stand up, but You [only] gaze [indifferently] at me. 

<sup>21</sup> 

You have become harsh and cruel to me; with the might of Your hand You [keep me alive only to] persecute me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

You lift me up on the wind; You cause me to ride upon it, and You toss me about in the tempest. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For I know that You will bring me to death and to the house [of meeting] appointed for all the living. 

<sup>24</sup> 

However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand? Or in his calamity will he not therefore cry for help? 

<sup>25</sup> 

Did not I weep for him who was in trouble? Was not my heart grieved for the poor and needy? 

<sup>26</sup> 

But when I looked for good, then evil came to me; and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 

<sup>27</sup> 

My heart is troubled and does not rest; days of affliction come to meet me. 

<sup>28</sup> 

I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the congregation and cry for help. 

<sup>29</sup> 

I am a brother to jackals [which howl], and a companion to ostriches [which scream dismally]. 

<sup>30</sup> 

My skin falls from me in blackened flakes, and my bones are burned with heat. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Therefore my lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.
