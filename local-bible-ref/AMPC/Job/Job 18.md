Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

How long will you lay snares for words and have to hunt for your argument? Do some clear thinking, and then we will reply. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Why are we counted as beasts [as if we had no sense]? Why are we unclean in your sight? 

<sup>4</sup> 

You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The light shall be dark in his dwelling, and his lamp beside him shall be put out. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The steps of his strength shall be shortened, and his own counsel and the plans in which he trusted shall bring about his downfall. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For the wicked is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks upon a lattice-covered pit. 

<sup>9</sup> 

A trap will catch him by the heel, and a snare will lay hold on him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

A noose is hidden for him on the ground and a trap for him in the way. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall chase him at his heels. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The strength [of the wicked] shall be hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side [if he halts]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

By disease his strength and his skin shall be devoured; the firstborn of death [the worst of diseases] shall consume his limbs. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He shall be rooted out of his dwelling place in which he trusted, and he shall be brought to the king of terrors [death]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his [family]; sulphur shall be scattered over his dwelling [to purify it after his going]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The roots [of the wicked] shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off and wither. 

<sup>17</sup> 

His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He shall be thrust from light into darkness and driven out of the world. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He shall neither have son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned. 

<sup>20</sup> 

They [of the west] that come after [the wicked man] shall be astonished and appalled at his day, as they [of the east] that went before were seized with horror. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, and such is the place of him who knows not (recognizes not and honors not) God.
