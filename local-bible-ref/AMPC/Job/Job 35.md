Elihu spoke further [to Job] and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Do you think this is your right, or are you saying, My righteousness is more than God's, 

<sup>3</sup> 

That you ask, What advantage have you? How am I profited more than if I had sinned? 

<sup>4</sup> 

I will answer you and your companions with you. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Look to the heavens and see; and behold the skies which are higher than you. 

<sup>6</sup> 

If you have sinned, how does that affect God? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him? 

<sup>7</sup> 

If you are righteous, what do you [by that] give God? Or what does He receive from your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Your wickedness touches and affects a man such as you are, and your righteousness is for yourself, one of the human race [but it cannot touch God, Who is above such influence]. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Because of the multitudes of oppressions the people cry out; they cry for help because of the violence of the mighty. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But no one says, Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs of rejoicing in the night, 

<sup>11</sup> 

Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens? 

<sup>12</sup> 

[The people] cry out because of the pride of evil men, but He does not answer. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Surely God will refuse to answer [the cry which is] vanity (vain and empty--instead of abiding trust); neither will the Almighty regard it-- 

<sup>14</sup> 

How much less when [missing His righteous judgment on earth] you say that you do not see Him, that your cause is before Him, and you are waiting for Him! 

<sup>15</sup> 

But now because God has not [speedily] punished in His anger and seems to be unaware of the wrong and oppression [of which a person is guilty], 

<sup>16</sup> 

Job uselessly opens his mouth and multiplies words without knowledge [drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked].
