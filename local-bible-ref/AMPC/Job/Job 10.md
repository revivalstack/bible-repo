<sup>1</sup> 

I am weary of my life and loathe it! I will give free expression to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

<sup>2</sup> 

I will say to God, Do not condemn me [do not make me guilty]! Show me why You contend with me. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Does it seem good to You that You should oppress, that You should despise and reject the work of Your hands, and favor the schemes of the wicked? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Have You eyes of flesh? Do You see as man sees? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Are Your days as the days of man, are Your years as man's [years], 

<sup>6</sup> 

That You inquire after my iniquity and search for my sin-- 

<sup>7</sup> 

Although You know that I am not wicked or guilty and that there is none who can deliver me out of Your hand? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Your hands have formed me and made me. Would You turn around and destroy me? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Remember [earnestly], I beseech You, that You have fashioned me as clay [out of the same earth material, exquisitely and elaborately]. And will You bring me into dust again? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Have You not poured me out like milk and curdled me like cheese? 

<sup>11</sup> 

You have clothed me with skin and flesh and have knit me together with bones and sinews. 

<sup>12</sup> 

You have granted me life and favor, and Your providence has preserved my spirit. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Yet these [the present evils] have You hid in Your heart [for me since my creation]; I know that this was with You [in Your purpose and thought]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

If I sin, then You observe me, and You will not acquit me from my iniquity and guilt. 

<sup>15</sup> 

If I am wicked, woe unto me! And if I am righteous, yet must I not lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and the sight of my affliction. 

<sup>16</sup> 

If I lift myself up, You hunt me like a lion and again show Yourself [inflicting] marvelous [trials] upon me. 

<sup>17</sup> 

You renew Your witnesses against me and increase Your indignation toward me; I am as if attacked by a troop time after time. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Why then did You bring me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me! 

<sup>19</sup> 

I should have been as though I had not existed; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Are not my days few? Cease then and let me alone, that I may take a little comfort and cheer up 

<sup>21</sup> 

Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death, 

<sup>22</sup> 

The land of sunless gloom as intense darkness, [the land] of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as thick darkness.
