Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Oh, that my impatience and vexation might be [thoroughly] weighed and all my calamity be laid up over against them in the balances, one against the other [to see if my grief is unmanly]! 

<sup>3</sup> 

For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash and wild, 

<sup>4</sup> 

[But it is] because the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison which my spirit drinks up; the terrors of God set themselves in array against me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Does the wild ass bray when it has grass? Or does the ox low over its fodder? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Can that which has no taste to it be eaten without salt? Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg? 

<sup>7</sup> 

[These afflictions] my soul refuses to touch! Such things are like diseased food to me [sickening and repugnant]! 

<sup>8</sup> 

Oh, that I might have my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

<sup>9</sup> 

I even wish that it would please God to crush me, that He would let loose His hand and cut me off! 

<sup>10</sup> 

Then would I still have consolation--yes, I would leap [for joy] amid unsparing pain [though I shrink from it]--that I have not concealed or denied the words of the Holy One! 

<sup>11</sup> 

What strength have I left, that I should wait and hope? And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Is my strength and endurance that of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze? 

<sup>13</sup> 

Is it not that I have no help in myself, and that wisdom is quite driven from me? 

<sup>14</sup> 

To him who is about to faint and despair, kindness is due from his friend, lest he forsake the fear of the Almighty. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[You] my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away, 

<sup>16</sup> 

Which are black and turbid by reason of the ice, and in which the snows hides itself; 

<sup>17</sup> 

When they get warm, they shrink and disappear; when it is hot, they vanish out of their place. 

<sup>18</sup> 

The caravans which travel by way of them turn aside; they go into the waste places and perish. [Such is my disappointment in you, the friends I fully trusted.] 

<sup>19</sup> 

The caravans of Tema looked [for water], the companies of Sheba waited for them [in vain]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

They were confounded because they had hoped [to find water]; they came there and were bitterly disappointed. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Now to me you are [like a dried-up brook]; you see my dismay and terror, and [believing me to be a victim of God's anger] you are afraid [to sympathize with me]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Did I ever say, Bring me a gift, or Pay a bribe on my account from your wealth 

<sup>23</sup> 

To deliver me from the adversary's hand, or Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors? 

<sup>24</sup> 

Teach me, and I will hold my peace; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred. 

<sup>25</sup> 

How forcible are words of straightforward speech! But what does your arguing argue and prove or your reproof reprove? 

<sup>26</sup> 

Do you imagine your words to be an argument, but the speeches of one who is desperate to be as wind? 

<sup>27</sup> 

Yes, you would cast lots over the fatherless and bargain away your friend. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Now be pleased to look upon me, that it may be evident to you if I lie [for surely I would not lie to your face]. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Return [from your suspicion], I pray you, let there be no injustice; yes, return again [to confidence in me], my vindication is in it. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Is there wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern what is destructive?
