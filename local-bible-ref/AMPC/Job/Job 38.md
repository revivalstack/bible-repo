Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Gird up now your loins like a man, and I will demand of you, and you declare to Me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare to Me, if you have and know understanding. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Who determined the measures of the earth, if you know? Or who stretched the measuring line upon it? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Upon what were the foundations of it fastened, or who laid its cornerstone, 

<sup>7</sup> 

When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Or who shut up the sea with doors when it broke forth and issued out of the womb?-- 

<sup>9</sup> 

When I made the clouds the garment of it, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it, 

<sup>10</sup> 

And marked for it My appointed boundary and set bars and doors, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And said, Thus far shall you come and no farther; and here shall your proud waves be stayed? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place, 

<sup>13</sup> 

So that [light] may get hold of the corners of the earth and shake the wickedness [of night] out of it? 

<sup>14</sup> 

It is changed like clay into which a seal is pressed; and things stand out like a many-colored garment. 

<sup>15</sup> 

From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Have you explored the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep? 

<sup>17</sup> 

Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the doors of deep darkness? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth? Tell Me, if you know it all. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Where is the way where light dwells? And as for darkness, where is its abode, 

<sup>20</sup> 

That you may conduct it to its home, and may know the paths to its house? 

<sup>21</sup> 

You must know, since you were born then! Or because you are so extremely old! 

<sup>22</sup> 

Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen the treasuries of the hail, 

<sup>23</sup> 

Which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? 

<sup>24</sup> 

By what way is the light distributed, or the east wind spread over the earth? 

<sup>25</sup> 

Who has prepared a channel for the torrents of rain, or a path for the thunderbolt, 

<sup>26</sup> 

To cause it to rain on the uninhabited land [and] on the desert where no man lives, 

<sup>27</sup> 

To satisfy the waste and desolate ground and to cause the tender grass to spring forth? 

<sup>28</sup> 

Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of dew? 

<sup>29</sup> 

Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who has given it birth? 

<sup>30</sup> 

The waters are congealed like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Can you bind the chains of [the cluster of stars called] Pleiades, or loose the cords of [the constellation] Orion? 

<sup>32</sup> 

Can you lead forth the signs of the zodiac in their season? Or can you guide [the stars of] the Bear with her young? 

<sup>33</sup> 

Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule upon the earth? 

<sup>34</sup> 

Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an abundance of waters may cover you? 

<sup>35</sup> 

Can you send lightnings, that they may go and say to you, Here we are? 

<sup>36</sup> 

Who has put wisdom in the inward parts [or in the dark clouds]? Or who has given understanding to the mind [or to the meteor]? 

<sup>37</sup> 

Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the [water] bottles of the heavens 

<sup>38</sup> 

When [heat has caused] the dust to run into a mass and the clods to cleave fast together? 

<sup>39</sup> 

Can you [Job] hunt the prey for the lion? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions 

<sup>40</sup> 

When they couch in their dens or lie in wait in their hiding place? 

<sup>41</sup> 

Who provides for the raven its prey when its young ones cry to God and wander about for lack of food?
