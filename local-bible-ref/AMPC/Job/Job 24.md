Why [seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty] does He not set seasons for judgment? Why do those who know Him see not His days [for punishment of the wicked]? 

<sup>2</sup> 

Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks and pasture them [appropriating land and flocks openly]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 

<sup>4</sup> 

They crowd the poor and needy off the road; the poor and meek of the earth all hide themselves. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Behold, as wild asses in the desert, [the poor] go forth to their work, seeking diligently for prey and food; the wilderness yields them bread for their children [in roots and herbage]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

They reap each one his fodder in a field [that is not his own], and they glean the vintage of the wicked man. 

<sup>7</sup> 

They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. 

<sup>8</sup> 

They are wet with the showers of the mountains and cling to the rock for want of shelter. 

<sup>9</sup> 

[The violent men whose wickedness seems unnoticed] pluck the fatherless infants from the breast [to sell or make them slaves], and take [the clothing on] the poor for a pledge, 

<sup>10</sup> 

So that the needy go about naked for lack of clothing, and though hungry, they must carry [but not eat from] the sheaves. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Among the olive rows [of the wicked, the poor] make oil; they tread [the fresh juice of the grape from] the presses, but suffer thirst. 

<sup>12</sup> 

From out of the populous city men groan, and the very life of the wounded cries for help; yet God [seemingly] regards not the wrong done them. 

<sup>13</sup> 

These wrongdoers are of those who rebel against the light; they know not its ways nor stay in its paths. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The murderer rises with the light; he kills the poor and the needy, and in the night he becomes as a thief. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me, and he puts a disguise upon his face. 

<sup>16</sup> 

In the dark, they dig through [the penetrable walls of] houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the sunlight. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For midnight is morning to all of them; for they are familiar with the terrors of deep darkness. 

<sup>18</sup> 

[You say] Swiftly such men pass away on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; [no treader] turns into their vineyards. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol (the place of the dead) those who have sinned. 

<sup>20</sup> 

The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered, and unrighteousness shall be broken like a tree [which cannot be healed]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

[The evil man] preys upon the barren, childless woman and does no good to the widow. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Yet [God] prolongs the life of the [wicked] mighty by His power; they rise up when they had despaired of life. 

<sup>23</sup> 

God gives them security, and they rest on it; and His eyes are upon their ways. 

<sup>24</sup> 

They are exalted for a little while, and then are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others are and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain. 

<sup>25</sup> 

And if this is not so, who will prove me a liar and make my speech worthless?
