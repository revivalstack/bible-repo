Man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He comes forth like a flower and withers; he flees also like a shadow and continues not. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And [Lord] do You open Your eyes upon such a one, and bring me into judgment with You? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one! 

<sup>5</sup> 

Since a man's days are already determined, and the number of his months is wholly in Your control, and he cannot pass the bounds of his allotted time-- 

<sup>6</sup> 

[O God] turn from him [and cease to watch him so pitilessly]; let him rest until he has accomplished as does a hireling the appointed time for his day. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that the tender shoots of it will not cease. [But there is no such hope for man.] 

<sup>8</sup> 

Though its roots grow old in the earth and its stock dies in the ground, 

<sup>9</sup> 

Yet through the scent [and breathing] of water [the stump of the tree] will bud and bring forth boughs like a young plant. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But [the brave, strong] man must die and lie prostrate; yes, man breathes his last, and where is he? 

<sup>11</sup> 

As waters evaporate from the lake, and the river drains and dries up, 

<sup>12</sup> 

So man lies down and does not rise [to his former state]. Till the heavens are no more, men will not awake nor be raised [physically] out of their sleep. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the unseen state), that You would conceal me until Your wrath is past, that You would set a definite time and then remember me earnestly [and imprint me on your heart]! 

<sup>14</sup> 

If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare and service I will wait, till my change and release shall come. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[Then] You would call and I would answer You; You would yearn for [me] the work of Your hands. 

<sup>16</sup> 

But now You number each of my steps and take note of my every sin. 

<sup>17</sup> 

My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You glue up my iniquity [to preserve it in full for the day of reckoning]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles to nothing, and as the rock is removed out of its place, 

<sup>19</sup> 

As waters wear away the stones and as floods wash away the soil of the earth, so You [O Lord] destroy the hope of man. 

<sup>20</sup> 

You prevail forever against him, and he passes on; You change his appearance [in death] and send him away [from the presence of the living]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; they are brought low, and he perceives it not. 

<sup>22</sup> 

But his body [lamenting its decay in the grave] shall grieve over him, and his soul shall mourn [over the body of clay which it once enlivened].
