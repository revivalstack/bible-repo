Elihu proceeded and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Bear with me and wait a little longer, and I will show you, for I have something still to say on God's behalf. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I will bring my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 

<sup>4</sup> 

For truly my words shall not be false; He Who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Behold! God is mighty, and yet despises no one nor regards anything as trivial; He is mighty in power of understanding and heart. 

<sup>6</sup> 

He does not prolong the life of the wicked, but gives the needy and afflicted their right. 

<sup>7</sup> 

He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous (the upright in right standing with God); but He sets them forever with kings upon the throne, and they are exalted. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And if they are bound in fetters [of adversity] and held by cords of affliction, 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then He shows to them [the true character of] their deeds and their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly [with presumption and self-sufficiency]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He also opens their ears to instruction and discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity. 

<sup>11</sup> 

If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness and joy. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword [of God's destructive judgments], and they shall die in ignorance of true knowledge. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But the godless and profane in heart heap up anger [at the divine discipline]; they do not cry to Him when He binds them [with cords of affliction]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

They die in youth, and their life perishes among the unclean (those who are sodomites). 

<sup>15</sup> 

He delivers the afflicted in their affliction and opens their ears [to His voice] in adversity. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Indeed, God would have allured you out of the mouth of distress into a broad place where there is no situation of perplexity or privation; and that which would be set on your table would be full of fatness. 

<sup>17</sup> 

But if you [Job] are filled with the judgment of the wicked, judgment and justice will keep hold on you. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For let not wrath entice you into scorning chastisements; and let not the greatness of the ransom [the suffering, if rightly endured] turn you aside. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Will your cry be sufficient to keep you from distress, or will all the force of your strength do it? 

<sup>20</sup> 

Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their places; 

<sup>21</sup> 

Take heed, turn not to iniquity, for this [the iniquity of complaining against God] you have chosen rather than [submission in] affliction. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Behold, God exalts and does loftily in His power; who is a ruler or a teacher like Him? 

<sup>23</sup> 

Who has appointed God His way? Or who can say, You have done unrighteousness? 

<sup>24</sup> 

Remember that [by submission] you magnify God's work, of which men have sung. 

<sup>25</sup> 

All men have looked upon God's work; man may behold it afar off. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Behold, God is great, and we know Him not! The number of His years is unsearchable. 

<sup>27</sup> 

For He draws up the drops of water, which distil as rain from His vapor, 

<sup>28</sup> 

Which the skies pour down and drop abundantly upon [the multitudes of] mankind. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Not only that, but can anyone understand the spreadings of the clouds or the thunderings of His pavilion? 

<sup>30</sup> 

Behold, He spreads His lightning against the dark clouds and covers the roots of the sea. 

<sup>31</sup> 

For by [His clouds] God executes judgment upon the peoples; He gives food in abundance. 

<sup>32</sup> 

He covers His hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark. 

<sup>33</sup> 

His thunderings speak [awesomely] concerning Him; the cattle are told of His coming storm.
