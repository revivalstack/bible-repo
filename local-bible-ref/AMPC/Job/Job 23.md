Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Even today is my complaint rebellious and bitter; my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Oh, that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to His seat! 

<sup>4</sup> 

I would lay my cause before Him and fill my mouth with arguments. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I would learn what He would answer me, and understand what He would say to me. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Would He plead against me with His great power? No, He would give heed to me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

There the righteous [one who is upright and in right standing with God] could reason with Him; so I should be acquitted by my Judge forever. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Behold, I go forward [and to the east], but He is not there; I go backward [and to the west], but I cannot perceive Him; 

<sup>9</sup> 

On the left hand [and to the north] where He works [I seek Him], but I cannot behold Him; He turns Himself to the right hand [and to the south], but I cannot see Him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But He knows the way that I take [He has concern for it, appreciates, and pays attention to it]. When He has tried me, I shall come forth as refined gold [pure and luminous]. 

<sup>11</sup> 

My foot has held fast to His steps; His ways have I kept and not turned aside. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have esteemed and treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But He is unchangeable, and who can turn Him? And what He wants to do, that He does. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For He performs [that which He has] planned for me, and of many such matters He is mindful. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Therefore am I troubled and terrified at His presence; when I consider, I am in dread and afraid of Him. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For God has made my heart faint, timid, and broken, and the Almighty has terrified me, 

<sup>17</sup> 

Because I was not cut off before the darkness [of these woes befell me], neither has He covered the thick darkness from my face.
