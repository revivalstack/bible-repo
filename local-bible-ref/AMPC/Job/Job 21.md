Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hear diligently my speech, and let this [your attention] be your consolation [given me]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Allow me, and I also will speak; and after I have spoken, mock on. 

<sup>4</sup> 

As for me, is my complaint to man or of him? And why should I not be impatient and my spirit be troubled? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Look at me and be astonished (appalled); and lay your hand upon your mouth. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Even when I remember, I am troubled and afraid; horror and trembling take hold of my flesh. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Why do the wicked live, become old, and become mighty in power? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Their children are established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Their houses are safe and in peace, without fear; neither is the rod of God upon them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Their bull breeds and fails not; their cows calve and do not miscarry. 

<sup>11</sup> 

They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children skip about. 

<sup>12</sup> 

They themselves lift up their voices and sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. 

<sup>13</sup> 

They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol (the unseen state) in a moment and peacefully. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Yet they say to God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we pray to Him? 

<sup>16</sup> 

But notice, [you say] the prosperity of the wicked is not in their power; the mystery [of God's dealings] with the ungodly is far from my comprehension. 

<sup>17</sup> 

How often [then] is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains and sorrows to them in His anger? 

<sup>18</sup> 

That they are like stubble before the wind and like chaff that the storm steals and carries away? 

<sup>19</sup> 

You say, God lays up [the punishment of the wicked man's] iniquity for his children. Let Him recompense it to the man himself, that he may know and feel it. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Let his own eyes see his destruction, and let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

<sup>21</sup> 

For what pleasure or interest has a man in his house and family after he is dead, when the number of his months is cut off? 

<sup>22</sup> 

Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing that He judges those who are on high? 

<sup>23</sup> 

One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet; 

<sup>24</sup> 

His pails are full of milk [his veins are filled with nourishment], and the marrow of his bones is fresh and moist, 

<sup>25</sup> 

Whereas another man dies in bitterness of soul and never tastes of pleasure or good fortune. 

<sup>26</sup> 

They lie down alike in the dust, and the worm spreads a covering over them. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Behold, I know your thoughts and plans and the devices with which you would wrong me. 

<sup>28</sup> 

For you say, Where is the house of the rich and liberal prince [meaning me]? And where is the tent in which the wicked [Job] dwelt? 

<sup>29</sup> 

Have you not asked those who travel this way, and do you not accept their testimony and evidences-- 

<sup>30</sup> 

That the evil man is [now] spared in the day of calamity and destruction, and they are led forth and away on the day of [God's] wrath? 

<sup>31</sup> 

But who declares [a man's] way [and rebukes] him to his face? And who pays him back for what he has done? 

<sup>32</sup> 

When he is borne to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. 

<sup>33</sup> 

The clods of the valley are sweet to him, and every man shall follow him to a grave, as innumerable people [have gone] before him. 

<sup>34</sup> 

How then can you comfort me with empty and futile words, since in your replies there lurks falsehood?
