[Job continued:] Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. 

<sup>2</sup> 

What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Surely I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue and reason my case with God [that He may explain the conflict between what I believe of Him and what I see of Him]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But you are forgers of lies [you defame my character most untruthfully]; you are all physicians of no value and have no remedy to offer. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Oh, that you would altogether hold your peace! Then you would evidence your wisdom and you might pass for wise men. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Will you speak unrighteously for God and talk deceitfully for Him? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Will you show partiality to Him [be unjust to me in order to gain favor with Him]? Will you act as special pleaders for God? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Would it be profitable for you if He should investigate your tactics [with me]? Or as one deceives and mocks a man, do you deceive and mock Him? 

<sup>10</sup> 

He will surely reprove you if you do secretly show partiality. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Shall not His majesty make you afraid, and should not your awe for Him restrain you? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes [valueless]; your defenses are defenses of clay [and will crumble]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Hold your peace! Let me alone, so I may speak; and let come on me what may. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hands [incurring the danger of God's wrath]? 

<sup>15</sup> 

[I do it because, though He slay me, yet will I wait for and trust Him and] behold, He will slay me; I have no hope--nevertheless, I will maintain and argue my ways before Him and even to His face. 

<sup>16</sup> 

This will be my salvation, that a polluted and godless man shall not come before Him. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Listen diligently to my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Behold now, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be justified and vindicated. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Who is he who will argue against and refute me? For then I would hold my peace and expire. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Only [O Lord] grant two conditions to me, and then will I not hide myself from You: 

<sup>21</sup> 

Withdraw Your hand and take this bodily suffering far from me; and let not my [reverent] dread of You terrify me. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then [Lord] call and I will answer, or let me speak, and You answer me. 

<sup>23</sup> 

How many are my iniquities and sins [that so much sorrow should come to me]? Make me recognize and know my transgression and my sin. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Why do You hide Your face [as if offended] and alienate me as if I were Your enemy? 

<sup>25</sup> 

Will You harass and frighten a [poor, helpless] leaf driven to and fro, and will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble? 

<sup>26</sup> 

For You write bitter things against me [in Your bill of indictment] and make me inherit and be accountable now for the iniquities of my youth. 

<sup>27</sup> 

You put my feet also in the stocks and observe critically all my paths; You set a circle and limit around the soles of my feet [which I must not overstep]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

And he wastes away as a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
