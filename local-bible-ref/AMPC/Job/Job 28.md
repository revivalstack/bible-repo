<sup>1</sup> 

Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold where they refine it. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the stone ore. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Man sets an end to darkness, and he searches out the farthest bounds for the ore buried in gloom and deep darkness. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Men break open shafts away from where people sojourn, in places forgotten by [human] foot; and [descend into them], hanging afar from men, they swing or flit to and fro. 

<sup>5</sup> 

As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath [its surface, down deep in the mine] there is blasting, turning it up as by fire. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Its stones are the bed of sapphires; it holds dust of gold [which he wins]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The proud beasts [and their young] have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Man puts forth his hand upon the flinty rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He cuts out channels and passages among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing. 

<sup>11</sup> 

[Man] binds the streams so that they do not trickle [into the mine], and the thing that is hidden he brings forth to light. 

<sup>12</sup> 

But where shall Wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 

<sup>13</sup> 

Man knows not the price of it; neither is it found in the land of the living. 

<sup>14</sup> 

The deep says, [Wisdom] is not in me; and the sea says, It is not with me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price of it. 

<sup>16</sup> 

It cannot be valued in [terms of] the gold of Ophir, in the precious onyx or beryl, or the sapphire. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Gold and glass cannot equal [Wisdom], nor can it be exchanged for jewels or vessels of fine gold. 

<sup>18</sup> 

No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; for the possession of Wisdom is even above rubies or pearls. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The topaz of Ethiopia cannot compare with it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. 

<sup>20</sup> 

From where then does Wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? 

<sup>21</sup> 

It is hidden from the eyes of all living, and knowledge of it is withheld from the birds of the heavens. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Abaddon (the place of destruction) and Death say, We have [only] heard the report of it with our ears. 

<sup>23</sup> 

God understands the way [to Wisdom] and He knows the place of it [Wisdom is with God alone]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 

<sup>25</sup> 

When He gave to the wind weight or pressure and allotted the waters by measure, 

<sup>26</sup> 

When He made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Then He saw [Wisdom] and declared it; He established it, yes, and searched it out [for His own use, and He alone possesses it]. 

<sup>28</sup> 

But to man He said, Behold, the reverential and worshipful fear of the Lord--that is Wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
