Then Zophar the Naamathite replied, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk [and making such great professions] be pronounced free from guilt or blame? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Should your boastings and babble make men keep silent? And when you mock and scoff, shall no man make you ashamed? 

<sup>4</sup> 

For you have said, My doctrine [that God afflicts the righteous knowingly] is pure, and I am clean in [God's] eyes. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But oh, that God would speak, and open His lips against you, 

<sup>6</sup> 

And that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For He is manifold in understanding! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your guilt and iniquity [deserve]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Can you find out the deep things of God, or can you by searching find out the limits of the Almighty [explore His depths, ascend to His heights, extend to His breadths, and comprehend His infinite perfection]? 

<sup>8</sup> 

His wisdom is as high as the heights of heaven! What can you do? It is deeper than Sheol (the place of the dead)! What can you know? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Longer in measure [and scope] is it than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

<sup>10</sup> 

If [God] sweeps in and arrests and calls into judgment, who can hinder Him? [If He is against a man, who shall call Him to account for it?] 

<sup>11</sup> 

For He recognizes and knows hollow, wicked, and useless men (men of falsehood); when He sees iniquity, will He not consider it? 

<sup>12</sup> 

But a stupid man will get wisdom [only] when a wild donkey's colt is born a man [as when he thinks himself free because he is lifted up in pride]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

If you set your heart aright and stretch out your hands to [God], 

<sup>14</sup> 

If you put sin out of your hand and far away from you and let not evil dwell in your tents; 

<sup>15</sup> 

Then can you lift up your face to Him without stain [of sin, and unashamed]; yes, you shall be steadfast and secure; you shall not fear. 

<sup>16</sup> 

For you shall forget your misery; you shall remember it as waters that pass away. 

<sup>17</sup> 

And [your] life shall be clearer than the noonday and rise above it; though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And you shall be secure and feel confident because there is hope; yes, you shall search about you, and you shall take your rest in safety. 

<sup>19</sup> 

You shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall sue for your favor. 

<sup>20</sup> 

But the eyes of the wicked shall look [for relief] in vain, and they shall not escape [the justice of God]; and their hope shall be to give up the ghost.
