<sup>1</sup> 

Do you know the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth [their young]? [Or] do you observe when the hinds are giving birth? [Do you attend to all this, Job?] 

<sup>2</sup> 

Can you number the months that they carry their offspring? Or do you know the time when they are delivered, 

<sup>3</sup> 

When they bow themselves, bring forth their young ones, [and] cast out their pains? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; they go forth and return not to them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Who has sent out the wild donkey, giving him his freedom? Or who has loosed the bands of the swift donkey [by which his tame brother is bound--he, the shy, the swift-footed, and the untamable], 

<sup>6</sup> 

Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place? 

<sup>7</sup> 

He scorns the tumult of the city and hears not the shoutings of the taskmaster. 

<sup>8</sup> 

The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Will the wild ox be willing to serve you, or remain beside your manger? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Can you bind the wild ox with a harness to the plow in the furrow? Or will he harrow the furrows for you? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Will you trust him because his strength is great, or to him will you leave your labor? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Will you depend upon him to bring home your seed and gather the grain of your threshing floor? [Who, Job, was the author of this strange variance in the disposition of animals so alike in appearance? Was it you?] 

<sup>13</sup> 

The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, [but] are they the pinions and plumage of love? 

<sup>14</sup> 

The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground and warms them in the dust, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Forgetting that a foot may crush them or that the wild beast may trample them. 

<sup>16</sup> 

She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labor is in vain because she has no sense of danger [for her unborn brood], 

<sup>17</sup> 

For God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has He imparted to her understanding. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Yet when she lifts herself up in flight, [so swift is she that] she can laugh to scorn the horse and his rider. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Have you given the horse his might? Have you clothed his neck with quivering and a shaking mane? 

<sup>20</sup> 

Was it you [Job] who made him to leap like a locust? The majesty of his [snorting] nostrils is terrible. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons [of armed men]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

He mocks at fear and is not dismayed or terrified; neither does he turn back [in battle] from the sword. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The quiver rattles upon him, as do the glittering spear and the lance [of his rider]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

[He seems in running to] devour the ground with fierceness and rage; neither can he stand still at the sound of the [war] trumpet. 

<sup>25</sup> 

As often as the trumpet sounds he says, Ha, ha! And he smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Is it by your wisdom [Job] that the hawk soars and stretches her wings toward the south [as winter approaches]? 

<sup>27</sup> 

Does the eagle mount up at your command and make his nest on [a] high [inaccessible place]? 

<sup>28</sup> 

On the cliff he dwells and remains securely, upon the point of the rock and the stronghold. 

<sup>29</sup> 

From there he spies out the prey; and his eyes see it afar off. 

<sup>30</sup> 

His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he.
