<sup>1</sup> 

Indeed, [at His thunderings] my heart also trembles and leaps out of its place. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Hear, oh, hear the roar of His voice and the sound of rumbling that goes out of His mouth! 

<sup>3</sup> 

Under the whole heaven He lets it loose, and His lightning to the ends of the earth. 

<sup>4</sup> 

After it His voice roars; He thunders with the voice of His majesty, and He restrains not [His lightnings against His adversaries] when His voice is heard. 

<sup>5</sup> 

God thunders marvelously with His voice; He does great things which we cannot comprehend. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For He says to the snow, Fall on the earth; likewise He speaks to the showers and to the downpour of His mighty rains. 

<sup>7</sup> 

God seals up (stops, brings to a standstill by severe weather) the hand of every man [and now under His seal their hands are forced to inactivity], that all men whom He has made may know His doings (His sovereign power and their subjection to it). 

<sup>8</sup> 

Then the beasts go into dens and remain in their lairs. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds. 

<sup>10</sup> 

By the breath of God ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen over. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He loads the thick cloud with moisture; He scatters the cloud of His lightning. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And it is turned round about by His guidance, that they may do whatever He commands them upon the face of the habitable earth. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Whether it be for correction or for His earth [generally] or for His mercy and loving-kindness, He causes it to come. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Hear this, O Job; stand still and consider the wondrous works of God. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Do you know how God lays His command upon them and causes the lightning of His [storm] cloud to shine? 

<sup>16</sup> 

Do you know how the clouds are balanced [and poised in the heavens], the wonderful works of Him Who is perfect in knowledge? 

<sup>17</sup> 

[Or] why your garments are hot when He quiets the earth [in sultry summer] with the [oppressive] south wind? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Can you along with Him spread out the sky, [which is] strong as a molten mirror? 

<sup>19</sup> 

Tell us [Job] with what words of man we may address such a Being; we cannot state our case because we are in the dark [in the presence of the unsearchable God]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So shall it be told Him that I wish to speak? If a man speaks, shall he be swallowed up? 

<sup>21</sup> 

And now men cannot look upon the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Golden brightness and splendor come out of the north; [if men can scarcely look upon it, how much less upon the] terrible splendor and majesty God has upon Himself! 

<sup>23</sup> 

Touching the Almighty, we cannot find Him out; He is excellent in power; and to justice and plenteous righteousness He does no violence [He will disregard no right]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Men therefore [reverently] fear Him; He regards and respects not any who are wise in heart [in their own understanding and conceit].
