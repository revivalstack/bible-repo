Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer, and I make haste [to offer it] for this reason. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame, but out of my understanding my spirit answers me. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Do you not know from of old, since the time that man was placed on the earth, 

<sup>5</sup> 

That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless and defiled is but for a moment? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Though his [proud] height mounts up to the heavens and his head reaches to the clouds, 

<sup>7</sup> 

Yet he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, Where is he? 

<sup>8</sup> 

He will fly away like a dream and will not be found; yes, he will be chased away as a vision of the night. 

<sup>9</sup> 

The eye which saw him will see him no more, neither will his [accustomed] place any more behold him. 

<sup>10</sup> 

The poor will oppress his children, and his hands will give back his [ill-gotten] wealth. 

<sup>11</sup> 

His bones are full of youthful energy, but it will lie down with him in the dust. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, 

<sup>13</sup> 

Though he is loath to let it go but keeps it still within his mouth, 

<sup>14</sup> 

Yet his food turns [to poison] in his stomach; it is the venom of asps within him. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He has swallowed down [his ill-gotten] riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God will cast them out of his belly. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He shall suck the poison of asps [which ill-gotten wealth contains]; the viper's tongue shall slay him. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter [to enjoy his wealth]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

That which he labored for shall he give back and shall not swallow it down [to enjoy it]; according to his wealth shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it. 

<sup>19</sup> 

For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has violently taken away a house which he did not build. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Because his desire and greed knew no quietness within him, he will not save anything of that in which he delights. 

<sup>21</sup> 

There was nothing left that he did not devour; therefore his prosperity will not endure. 

<sup>22</sup> 

In the fullness of his sufficiency [in the time of his great abundance] he shall be poor and in straits; every hand of everyone who is in misery shall come upon him [he is but a wretch on every side]. 

<sup>23</sup> 

When he is about to fill his belly [as in the wilderness when God sent the quails], God will cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him and will rain it upon him while he is eating. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He will flee from the iron weapon, but the bow of bronze shall strike him through. 

<sup>25</sup> 

[The arrow] is drawn forth and it comes out after passing through his body; yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall. Terrors march in upon him; 

<sup>26</sup> 

Every misfortune is laid up for his treasures. A fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume what is left in his tent [and it shall go ill with him who remains there]. 

<sup>27</sup> 

The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. 

<sup>28</sup> 

The produce and increase of his house will go into exile [with the victors], dragged away in the day of [God's] wrath. 

<sup>29</sup> 

This is the wicked man's portion from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.
