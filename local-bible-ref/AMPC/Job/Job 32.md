So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was [rigidly] righteous (upright and in right standing with God) in his own eyes. [But there was a fifth man there also.] 

<sup>2</sup> 

Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled against Job because he justified himself rather than God [even made himself out to be better than God]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Also against [Job's] three friends was [Elihu's] anger kindled, because they had found no answer [were unable to show his real error], and yet they had declared him to be in the wrong [and responsible for his own afflictions]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he became angry. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite said, I am young, and you are aged; for that reason I was timid and restrained and dared not declare my opinion to you. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I said, Age should speak, and a multitude of years should teach wisdom [so let it be heard]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But there is [a vital force] a spirit [of intelligence] in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives men understanding. 

<sup>9</sup> 

It is not the great [necessarily] who are wise, nor [always] the aged who understand justice. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So I say, Listen to me; I also will give you my opinion [about Job's situation] and my knowledge. 

<sup>11</sup> 

You see, I waited for your words, I listened to your wise reasons, while you searched out what to say. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Yes, I paid attention to what you said, and behold, not one of you convinced Job or made [satisfactory] replies to his words [you could not refute him]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Beware lest you say, We have found wisdom; God thrusts [Job] down [justly], not man [God alone is dealing with him]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Now [Job] has not directed his words against me [therefore I have no cause for irritation], neither will I answer him with speeches like yours. [I speak for truth, not for revenge.] 

<sup>15</sup> 

[Job's friends] are amazed and embarrassed, they answer no more; they have not a thing to say [reports Elihu]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

And shall I wait, because they say nothing but stand still and answer no more? 

<sup>17</sup> 

I also will answer my [God-assigned] part; I also will declare my opinion and my knowledge. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

My breast is as wine that has no vent; like new wineskins, it is ready to burst. 

<sup>20</sup> 

I must speak, that I may get relief and be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer. 

<sup>21</sup> 

I will not [I warn you] be influenced by respect for any man's person and show partiality, neither will I flatter any man. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For I know not how to flatter, [wasting my time in mere formalities, for then] my Maker would soon take me away.
