<sup>1</sup> 

Call now--is there any who will answer you? And to which of the holy [angels] will you turn? 

<sup>2</sup> 

For vexation and rage kill the foolish man; jealousy and indignation slay the simple. 

<sup>3</sup> 

I have seen the foolish taking root [and outwardly prospering], but suddenly I saw that his dwelling was cursed [for his doom was certain]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

His children are far from safety; [involved in their father's ruin] they are crushed in the [court of justice in the city's] gate, and there is no one to deliver them. 

<sup>5</sup> 

His harvest the hungry eat and take it even [when it grows] among the thorns; the snare opens for [his] wealth. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For affliction comes not forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring forth out of the ground. 

<sup>7</sup> 

But man is born to trouble as the sparks and the flames fly upward. 

<sup>8</sup> 

As for me, I would seek God and inquire of and require Him, and to God would I commit my cause-- 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters upon the fields, 

<sup>11</sup> 

So that He sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn He lifts to safety. 

<sup>12</sup> 

He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise or anything of [lasting] worth. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He catches the [so-called] wise in their own trickiness, and the counsel of the schemers is brought to a quick end. 

<sup>14</sup> 

In the daytime they meet in darkness, and at noon they grope as in the night. 

<sup>15</sup> 

But [God] saves [the fatherless] from the sword of their mouth, and the needy from the hand of the mighty. 

<sup>16</sup> 

So the poor have hope, and iniquity shuts her mouth. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Happy and fortunate is the man whom God reproves; so do not despise or reject the correction of the Almighty [subjecting you to trial and suffering]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

For He wounds, but He binds up; He smites, but His hands heal. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He will rescue you in six troubles; in seven nothing that is evil [for you] will touch you. 

<sup>20</sup> 

In famine He will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. 

<sup>21</sup> 

You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes. 

<sup>22</sup> 

At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the living creatures of the earth. 

<sup>23</sup> 

For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 

<sup>24</sup> 

And you shall know that your tent shall be in peace, and you shall visit your fold and your dwelling and miss nothing [from them]. 

<sup>25</sup> 

You shall know also that your children shall be many, and your offspring as the grass of the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> 

You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, and as a shock of grain goes up [to the threshing floor] in its season. 

<sup>27</sup> 

This is what we have searched out; it is true. Hear and heed it and know for yourself [for your good].
