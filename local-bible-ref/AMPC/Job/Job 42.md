Then Job said to the Lord, 

<sup>2</sup> 

I know that You can do all things, and that no thought or purpose of Yours can be restrained or thwarted. 

<sup>3</sup> 

[You said to me] Who is this that darkens and obscures counsel [by words] without knowledge? Therefore [I now see] I have [rashly] uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[I had virtually said to You what You have said to me:] Hear, I beseech You, and I will speak; I will demand of You, and You declare to me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

I had heard of You [only] by the hearing of the ear, but now my [spiritual] eye sees You. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Therefore I loathe [my words] and abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes. 

<sup>7</sup> 

After the Lord had spoken the previous words to Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Now therefore take seven bullocks and seven rams and go to My servant Job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept [his prayer] that I deal not with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job has. 

<sup>9</sup> 

So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord commanded them; and the Lord accepted [Job's prayer]. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the Lord turned the captivity of Job and restored his fortunes, when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Then there came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him over all the [distressing] calamities that the Lord had brought upon him. Every man also gave him a piece of money, and every man an earring of gold. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He had also seven sons and three daughters. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And he called the name of the first Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And in all the land there were no women so fair as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers. 

<sup>16</sup> 

After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his sons' sons, even to four generations. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So Job died, an old man and full of days.
