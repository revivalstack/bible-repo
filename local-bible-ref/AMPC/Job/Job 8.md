Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, 

<sup>2</sup> 

How long will you say these things [Job]? And how long shall the words of your mouth be as a mighty wind? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness? 

<sup>4</sup> 

If your children have sinned against Him, then He has delivered them into the power of their transgression. 

<sup>5</sup> 

If you will seek God diligently and make your supplication to the Almighty, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then, if you are pure and upright, surely He will bestir Himself for you and make your righteous dwelling prosperous again. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For inquire, I pray you, of the former age and apply yourself to that which their fathers have searched out, 

<sup>9</sup> 

For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Shall not [the forefathers] teach you and tell you and utter words out of their hearts (the deepest part of their nature)? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Can the rush or papyrus grow up without marsh? Can the flag or reed grass grow without water? 

<sup>12</sup> 

While it is yet green, in flower, and not cut down, it withers before any other herb [when without water]. 

<sup>13</sup> 

So are the ways of all who forget God; and the hope of the godless shall perish. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For his confidence breaks, and [the object of] his trust is a spider's web. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold fast to it, but it shall not last. 

<sup>16</sup> 

He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden. 

<sup>17</sup> 

[Godless] his roots are wrapped about the [stone] heap, and see their way [promisingly] among the rocks. 

<sup>18</sup> 

But if [God] snatches him from his property, [then having passed into the hands of others] it [his property] will forget and deny him, [saying,] I have never seen you [before, as if ashamed of him--like his former friends]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

See, this is the joy of going the way [of the ungodly]! And from the dust others will spring up [to take his place]. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Behold, as surely as God will never uphold wrongdoers, He will never cast away a blameless man. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He will yet fill your mouth with laughter [Job] and your lips with joyful shouting. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tents of the wicked shall be no more.
