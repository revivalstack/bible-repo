Then Job answered: 

<sup>2</sup> 

How long will you vex and torment me and break me in pieces with words? 

<sup>3</sup> 

These ten times you have reproached me; you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange [harden yourselves against me and deal severely with me]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And if it were true that I have erred, my error would remain with me [I would be conscious of it]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach and humiliation, 

<sup>6</sup> 

Know that God has overthrown and put me in the wrong and has closed His net about me. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Behold, I cry out, Violence! but I am not heard; I cry aloud for help, but there is no justice. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He has walled up my way so that I cannot pass, and He has set darkness upon my paths. 

<sup>9</sup> 

He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head. 

<sup>10</sup> 

He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone; my hope has He pulled up like a tree. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He has also kindled His wrath against me, and He counts me as one of His adversaries. 

<sup>12</sup> 

His troops come together and cast up their way and siege works against me and encamp round about my tent. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are wholly estranged from me. 

<sup>14</sup> 

My kinsfolk have failed me, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Those who live temporarily in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight. 

<sup>16</sup> 

I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer, though I beseech him with words. 

<sup>17</sup> 

I am repulsive to my wife and loathsome to the children of my own mother. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Even young children despise me; when I get up, they speak against me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

All the men of my council and my familiar friends abhor me; those whom I loved are turned against me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin or gums of my teeth. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Have pity on me! Have pity on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! 

<sup>22</sup> 

Why do you, as if you were God, pursue and persecute me? [Acting like wild beasts] why are you not satisfied with my flesh? 

<sup>23</sup> 

Oh, that the words I now speak were written! Oh, that they were inscribed in a book [carved on a tablet of stone]! 

<sup>24</sup> 

That with an iron pen and [molten] lead they were graven in the rock forever! 

<sup>25</sup> 

For I know that my Redeemer and Vindicator lives, and at last He [the Last One] will stand upon the earth. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And after my skin, even this body, has been destroyed, then from my flesh or without it I shall see God, 

<sup>27</sup> 

Whom I, even I, shall see for myself and on my side! And my eyes shall behold Him, and not as a stranger! My heart pines away and is consumed within me. 

<sup>28</sup> 

If you say, How we will pursue him! [and continue to persecute me with the claim] that the root [cause] of all these [afflictions] is found in me, 

<sup>29</sup> 

Then beware and be afraid of the sword [of divine vengeance], for wrathful are the punishments of that sword, that you may know there is a judgment.
