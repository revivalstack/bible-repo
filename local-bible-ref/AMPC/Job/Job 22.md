Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered [Job], 

<sup>2</sup> 

Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he that is wise is profitable to himself. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Is it any pleasure or advantage to the Almighty that you are righteous (upright and in right standing with Him)? Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Is it for your [reverential] fear of Him that He [thus] reproves you, that He enters with you into judgment? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Is not your wickedness great? There is no end to your iniquities. 

<sup>6</sup> 

For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

<sup>7</sup> 

You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 

<sup>8</sup> 

But [you, Job] the man with power possessed the land, and the favored and accepted man dwelt in it. 

<sup>9</sup> 

You have sent widows away empty-handed, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles and overwhelms you; 

<sup>11</sup> 

Your light is darkened, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 

<sup>13</sup> 

Therefore you say, How and what does God know [about me]? Can He judge through the thick darkness? 

<sup>14</sup> 

Thick clouds are a covering to Him, so that He does not see, and He walks on the vault of the heavens. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Will you pay attention and keep to the old way that wicked men trod [in Noah's time], 

<sup>16</sup> 

Men who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out like a stream [during the flood]? 

<sup>17</sup> 

They said to God, Depart from us, and, What can the Almighty do for or to us? 

<sup>18</sup> 

Yet He filled their houses with good [things]. But the counsel of the ungodly is far from me. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The righteous see it and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn [saying], 

<sup>20</sup> 

Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, and that which remained to them the fire has consumed. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Acquaint now yourself with Him [agree with God and show yourself to be conformed to His will] and be at peace; by that [you shall prosper and great] good shall come to you. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Receive, I pray you, the law and instruction from His mouth and lay up His words in your heart. 

<sup>23</sup> 

If you return to the Almighty [and submit and humble yourself before Him], you will be built up; if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents, 

<sup>24</sup> 

If you lay gold in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brook [considering them of little worth], 

<sup>25</sup> 

And make the Almighty your gold and [the Lord] your precious silver treasure, 

<sup>26</sup> 

Then you will have delight in the Almighty, and you will lift up your face to God. 

<sup>27</sup> 

You will make your prayer to Him, and He will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 

<sup>28</sup> 

You shall also decide and decree a thing, and it shall be established for you; and the light [of God's favor] shall shine upon your ways. 

<sup>29</sup> 

When they make [you] low, you will say, [There is] a lifting up; and the humble person He lifts up and saves. 

<sup>30</sup> 

He will even deliver the one [for whom you intercede] who is not innocent; yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.
