Then Job answered and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

Yes, I know it is true. But how can mortal man be right before God? 

<sup>3</sup> 

If one should want to contend with Him, he cannot answer one [of His questions] in a thousand. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[God] is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has [ever] hardened himself against Him and prospered or even been safe? 

<sup>5</sup> 

[God] Who removes the mountains, and they know it not when He overturns them in His anger; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Who shakes the earth out of its place, and the pillars of it tremble; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Who commands the sun, and it rises not; Who seals up the stars [from view]; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Who alone stretches out the heavens and treads upon the waves and high places of the sea; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who made [the constellations] the Bear, Orion, and the [loose cluster] Pleiades, and the [vast starry] spaces of the south; 

<sup>10</sup> 

Who does great things past finding out, yes, marvelous things without number. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Behold, He goes by me, and I see Him not; He passes on also, but I perceive Him not. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Behold, He snatches away; who can hinder or turn Him back? Who will say to Him, What are You doing? 

<sup>13</sup> 

God will not withdraw His anger; the [proud] helpers of Rahab [arrogant monster of the sea] bow under Him. 

<sup>14</sup> 

How much less shall I answer Him, choosing out my words to reason with Him 

<sup>15</sup> 

Whom, though I were righteous (upright and innocent) yet I could not answer? I must appeal for mercy to my Opponent and Judge [for my right]. 

<sup>16</sup> 

If I called and He answered me, yet would I not believe that He listened to my voice. 

<sup>17</sup> 

For He overwhelms and breaks me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 

<sup>19</sup> 

If I speak of strength, behold, He is mighty! And if of justice, Who, says He, will summon Me? 

<sup>20</sup> 

Though I am innocent and in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, He would prove me perverse. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Though I am blameless, I regard not myself; I despise my life. 

<sup>22</sup> 

It is all one; therefore I say, God [does not discriminate, but] destroys the blameless and the wicked. 

<sup>23</sup> 

When [His] scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the calamity and trial of the innocent. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The earth is given into the hands of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges [so that they are blinded to justice]. If it is not [God], who then is it [responsible for all this inequality]? 

<sup>25</sup> 

Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good. 

<sup>26</sup> 

They are passed away like the swift rowboats made of reeds, or like the eagle that swoops down on the prey. 

<sup>27</sup> 

If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer and brighten up, 

<sup>28</sup> 

I become afraid of all my pains and sorrows [yet to come], for I know You will not pronounce me innocent [by removing them]. 

<sup>29</sup> 

I shall be held guilty and be condemned; why then should I labor in vain [to appear innocent]? 

<sup>30</sup> 

If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, 

<sup>31</sup> 

Yet You will plunge me into the ditch, and my own clothes will abhor me [and refuse to cover so foul a body]. 

<sup>32</sup> 

For [God] is not a [mere] man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in court. 

<sup>33</sup> 

There is no umpire between us, who might lay his hand upon us both, [would that there were!] 

<sup>34</sup> 

That He might take His rod away from [threatening] me, and that the fear of Him might not terrify me. 

<sup>35</sup> 

[Then] would I speak and not fear Him, but I am not so in myself [to make me afraid, were only a fair trial given me].
