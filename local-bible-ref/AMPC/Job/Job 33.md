<sup>1</sup> 

Be that as it may, Job, I beg of you to hear what I have to say and give heed to all my words. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Behold, here I am with open mouth; here is my tongue talking. 

<sup>3</sup> 

My words shall express the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall speak what they know with utter sincerity. 

<sup>4</sup> 

[It is] the Spirit of God that made me [which has stirred me up], and the breath of the Almighty that gives me life [which inspires me]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Answer me now, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Behold, I am toward God and before Him even as you are; I also am formed out of the clay [though I speak with abnormal wisdom because of a divine illumination]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

See my terror [for I am only a fellow mortal, not God]; I shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy upon you. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying, 

<sup>9</sup> 

I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But behold, God finds occasions against me and causes of alienation and indifference; He counts me as His enemy. 

<sup>11</sup> 

He puts my feet in the stocks; He [untrustingly] watches all my paths [you say]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

I reply to you, Behold, in this you are not just; God is superior to man. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Why do you contend against Him? For He does not give account of any of His actions. [Sufficient for us it should be to know that it is He Who does them.] 

<sup>14</sup> 

For God [does reveal His will; He] speaks not only once, but more than once, even though men do not regard it [including you, Job]. 

<sup>15</sup> 

[One may hear God's voice] in a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men while slumbering upon the bed, 

<sup>16</sup> 

Then He opens the ears of men and seals their instruction [terrifying them with warnings], 

<sup>17</sup> 

That He may withdraw man from his purpose and cut off pride from him [disgusting him with his own disappointing self-sufficiency]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He holds him back from the pit [of destruction], and his life from perishing by the sword [of God's destructive judgments]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[God's voice may be heard by man when] he is chastened with pain upon his bed and with continual strife in his bones or while all his bones are firmly set, 

<sup>20</sup> 

So that his desire makes him loathe food, and even dainty dishes [nauseate him]. 

<sup>21</sup> 

His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Yes, his soul draws near to corruption, and his life to the inflicters of death (the destroyers). 

<sup>23</sup> 

[God's voice may be heard] if there is for the hearer a messenger or an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him [how to be upright and in right standing with God], 

<sup>24</sup> 

Then [God] is gracious to him and says, Deliver him from going down into the pit [of destruction]; I have found a ransom (a price of redemption, an atonement)! 

<sup>25</sup> 

[Then the man's] flesh shall be restored; it becomes fresher and more tender than a child's; he returns to the days of his youth. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He prays to God, and He is favorable to him, so that he sees His face with joy; for [God] restores to him his righteousness (his uprightness and right standing with God--with its joys). 

<sup>27</sup> 

He looks upon other men or sings out to them, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me, or He did not requite me [according to my iniquity]! 

<sup>28</sup> 

[God] has redeemed my life from going down to the pit [of destruction], and my life shall see the light! 

<sup>29</sup> 

[Elihu comments] Behold, God does all these things twice, yes, three times, with a man, 

<sup>30</sup> 

To bring back his life from the pit [of destruction], that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Give heed, O Job, listen to me; hold your peace, and I will speak. 

<sup>32</sup> 

If you have anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you. 

<sup>33</sup> 

If [you do] not [have anything to say], listen to me; hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.
