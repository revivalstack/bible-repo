<sup>1</sup> 

My spirit is broken, my days are spent (snuffed out); the grave is ready for me. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Surely there are mockers and mockery around me, and my eye dwells on their obstinacy, insults, and resistance. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Give me a pledge with Yourself [acknowledge my innocence before my death]; who is there that will give security for me? 

<sup>4</sup> 

But their hearts [Lord] You have closed to understanding; therefore You will not let them triumph [by giving them a verdict against me]. 

<sup>5</sup> 

He who denounces his friends [in order to make them] a prey and get a share, the eyes of his children shall fail [to find food]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

But He has made me a byword among the people, and they spit before my face. 

<sup>7</sup> 

My eye has grown dim because of grief, and all my members are [wasted away] like a shadow. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Upright men shall be astonished and appalled at this, and the innocent shall stir himself up against the godless and polluted. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Yet shall the righteous (those upright and in right standing with God) hold to their ways, and he who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger. 

<sup>10</sup> 

But as for you, come on again, all of you, though I find not a wise man among you. 

<sup>11</sup> 

My days are past, my purposes and plans are frustrated; even the thoughts (desires and possessions) of my heart [are broken off]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

These [thoughts] extend from the night into the day, [so that] the light is short because of darkness. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But if I look to Sheol (the unseen state) as my abode, if I spread my couch in the darkness, 

<sup>14</sup> 

If I say to the grave and corruption, You are my father, and to the worm [that feeds on decay], You are my mother and my sister [because I will soon be closest to you], 

<sup>15</sup> 

Where then is my hope? And if I have hope, who will see [its fulfillment]? 

<sup>16</sup> 

[My hope] shall go down to the bars of Sheol (the unseen state) when once there is rest in the dust.
