<sup>1</sup> 

Can you draw out the leviathan (the crocodile) with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord? 

<sup>2</sup> 

Can you put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook or a spike? 

<sup>3</sup> 

Will he make many supplications to you [begging to be spared]? Will he speak soft words to you [to coax you to treat him kindly]? 

<sup>4</sup> 

Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever? 

<sup>5</sup> 

Will you play with [the crocodile] as with a bird? Or will you put him on a leash for your maidens? 

<sup>6</sup> 

Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 

<sup>7</sup> 

Can you fill his skin with harpoons? Or his head with fishing spears? 

<sup>8</sup> 

Lay your hand upon him! Remember your battle with him; you will not do [such an ill-advised thing] again! 

<sup>9</sup> 

Behold, the hope of [his assailant] is disappointed; one is cast down even at the sight of him! 

<sup>10</sup> 

No one is so fierce [and foolhardy] that he dares to stir up [the crocodile]; who then is he who can stand before Me [the beast's Creator, or dares to contend with Me]? 

<sup>11</sup> 

Who has first given to Me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heavens is Mine. [Therefore, who can have a claim against God, God Who made the unmastered crocodile?] 

<sup>12</sup> 

I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Who can strip off [the crocodile's] outer garment? [Who can penetrate his double coat of mail?] Who shall come within his jaws? 

<sup>14</sup> 

Who can open the doors of his [lipless] mouth? His [extended jaws and bare] teeth are terrible round about. 

<sup>15</sup> 

His scales are [the crocodile's] pride, [for his back is made of rows of shields] shut up together [as with] a tight seal; 

<sup>16</sup> 

One is so near to another that no air can come between them. 

<sup>17</sup> 

They are joined one to another; they stick together so that they cannot be separated. 

<sup>18</sup> 

His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the [reddish] eyelids of the dawn. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Out of his mouth go burning torches, [and] sparks of fire leap out. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as out of a seething pot over a fire of rushes. 

<sup>21</sup> 

His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes forth from his mouth. 

<sup>22</sup> 

In [the crocodile's] neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The folds of his flesh cleave together; they are firm upon him, and they cannot shake [when he moves]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

His heart is as firm as a stone, indeed, as solid as a nether millstone. 

<sup>25</sup> 

When [the crocodile] raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; because of terror and the crashing they are beside themselves. 

<sup>26</sup> 

Even if one strikes at him with the sword, it cannot get any hold, nor does the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 

<sup>27</sup> 

He counts iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood. 

<sup>28</sup> 

The arrow cannot make [the crocodile] flee; slingstones are treated by him as stubble. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Clubs [also] are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rushing and the rattling of the javelin. 

<sup>30</sup> 

His underparts are like sharp pieces of broken pottery; he spreads [grooves like] a threshing sledge upon the mire. 

<sup>31</sup> 

He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a [foaming] pot of ointment. 

<sup>32</sup> 

[His swift darting] makes a shining track behind him; one would think the deep to be hoary [with foam]. 

<sup>33</sup> 

Upon earth there is not [the crocodile's] equal, a creature made without fear and he behaves fearlessly. 

<sup>34</sup> 

He looks all mighty [beasts of prey] in the face [without terror]; he is monarch over all the sons of pride. [And now, Job, who are you who dares not arouse the unmastered crocodile, yet who dares resist Me, the beast's Creator, to My face? Everything under the heavens is Mine; therefore, who can have a claim against God?]
