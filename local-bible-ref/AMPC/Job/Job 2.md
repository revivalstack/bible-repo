Again there was a day when the sons of God [the angels] came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan (the adversary and the accuser) came also among them to present himself before the Lord. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan, From where do you come? And Satan (the adversary and the accuser) answered the Lord, From going to and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan, Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who [reverently] fears God and abstains from and shuns all evil [because it is wrong]? And still he holds fast his integrity, although you moved Me against him to destroy him without cause. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then Satan answered the Lord, Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has will he give for his life. 

<sup>5</sup> 

But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse and renounce You to Your face. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the Lord said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life. 

<sup>7</sup> 

So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord and smote Job with loathsome and painful sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself, and he sat [down] among the ashes. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your blameless uprightness? Renounce God and die! 

<sup>10</sup> 

But he said to her, You speak as one of the impious and foolish women would speak. What? Shall we accept [only] good at the hand of God and shall we not accept [also] misfortune and what is of a bad nature? In [spite of] all this, Job did not sin with his lips. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came each one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, for they had made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And when they looked from afar off and saw him [disfigured] beyond recognition, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe, and they cast dust over their heads toward the heavens. 

<sup>13</sup> 

So they sat down with [Job] on the ground for seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief and pain were very great.
