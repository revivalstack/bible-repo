Then Job answered, 

<sup>2</sup> 

No doubt you are the [only wise] people [in the world], and wisdom will die with you! 

<sup>3</sup> 

But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these [of God's wisdom and might]? 

<sup>4</sup> 

I am become one who is a laughingstock to his friend; I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him--a just, upright (blameless) man--laughed to scorn! 

<sup>5</sup> 

In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune--but it is ready for those whose feet slip. 

<sup>6</sup> 

The dwellings of robbers prosper; those who provoke God are [apparently] secure; God supplies them abundantly [who have no god but their own hands and power]. 

<sup>7</sup> 

For ask now the animals, and they will teach you [that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character]; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Or speak to the earth [with its other forms of life], and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare [this truth] to you. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Who [is so blind as] not to recognize in all these [that good and evil are promiscuously scattered throughout nature and human life] that it is God's hand which does it [and God's way]? 

<sup>10</sup> 

In His hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Is it not the task of the ear to discriminate between [wise and unwise] words, just as the mouth distinguishes [between desirable and undesirable] food? 

<sup>12</sup> 

With the aged [you say] is wisdom, and with length of days comes understanding. 

<sup>13</sup> 

But [only] with [God] are [perfect] wisdom and might; He [alone] has [true] counsel and understanding. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be built again; He shuts a man in, and none can open. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He withholds the waters, and the land dries up; again, He sends forth [rains], and they overwhelm the land or transform it. 

<sup>16</sup> 

With Him are might and wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are His [and in His power]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

He leads [great and scheming] counselors away stripped and barefoot and makes the judges fools [in human estimation, by overthrowing their plans]. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He looses the fetters [ordered] by kings and has [the] waistcloth [of a slave] bound about their [own] loins. 

<sup>19</sup> 

He leads away priests as spoil, and men firmly seated He overturns. 

<sup>20</sup> 

He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment and discretion of the aged. 

<sup>21</sup> 

He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong [disabling them, bringing low the pride of the learned]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

He uncovers deep things out of darkness and brings into light black gloom and the shadow of death. 

<sup>23</sup> 

He makes nations great, and He destroys them; He enlarges nations [and then straitens and shrinks them again], and leads them [away captive]. 

<sup>24</sup> 

He takes away understanding from the leaders of the people of the land and of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no path. 

<sup>25</sup> 

They grope in the dark without light, and He makes them to stagger and wander like a drunken man.
