Job again took up his discourse and said, 

<sup>2</sup> 

As God lives, Who has taken away my right and denied me justice, and the Almighty, Who has vexed and embittered my life, 

<sup>3</sup> 

As long as my life is still whole within me, and the breath of God is [yet] in my nostrils, 

<sup>4</sup> 

My lips shall not speak untruth, nor shall my tongue utter deceit. 

<sup>5</sup> 

God forbid that I should justify you--saying you are right [in your accusations against me]; till I die, I will not put away my integrity from me. 

<sup>6</sup> 

My uprightness and my right standing with God I hold fast and will not let them go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days and it shall not reproach me as long as I live. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 

<sup>8</sup> 

For what is the hope of the godless and polluted, even though he has gained [in this world], when God cuts him off and takes away his life? 

<sup>9</sup> 

Will God hear his cry when trouble comes upon him? 

<sup>10</sup> 

Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? 

<sup>11</sup> 

I will teach you regarding the hand and handiwork of God; that which is with the Almighty [God's actual treatment of the wicked man] will I not conceal. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain [cherishing foolish notions]? 

<sup>13</sup> 

This [which I am about to tell] is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage which oppressors shall receive from the Almighty: 

<sup>14</sup> 

If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring will not have sufficient bread. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Those who survive him, [the pestilence] will bury, and [their] widows will make no lamentation. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up clothing like clay, 

<sup>17</sup> 

He may prepare it, but the just will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. 

<sup>18</sup> 

He builds his house like a moth or a spider, like a booth which a watchman makes [to last for a season]. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[The wicked] will lie down rich, but does it not again; he opens his eyes, and [his wealth] is gone. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Terrors overtake him like a [suddenly loosened] flood; a windstorm steals him away in the night. 

<sup>21</sup> 

The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 

<sup>22</sup> 

For [God and the storm] hurl at him without pity and unsparingly [their thunderbolts of wrath]; he flees in haste before His power. 

<sup>23</sup> 

[God causes] men to clap their hands at him [in malignant joy] and hiss him out of his place.
