After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day (birthday). 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Job said, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which announced, There is a man-child conceived. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Let that day be darkness! May not God above regard it, nor light shine upon it. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Let gloom and deep darkness claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that blackens the day terrify it (the day that I was born). 

<sup>6</sup> 

As for that night, let thick darkness seize it; let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Yes, let that night be solitary and barren; let no joyful voice come into it. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled in rousing up Leviathan. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Let the stars of the early dawn of that day be dark; let [the morning] look in vain for the light, nor let it behold the day's dawning, 

<sup>10</sup> 

Because it shut not the doors of my mother's womb nor hid sorrow and trouble from my eyes. 

<sup>11</sup> 

Why was I not stillborn? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bore me? 

<sup>12</sup> 

Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck? 

<sup>13</sup> 

For then would I have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then would I have been at rest [in death] 

<sup>14</sup> 

With kings and counselors of the earth, who built up [now] desolate ruins for themselves, 

<sup>15</sup> 

Or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Or [why] was I not a miscarriage, hidden and put away, as infants who never saw light? 

<sup>17</sup> 

There [in death] the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest. 

<sup>18</sup> 

There the [captive] prisoners rest together; they hear not the taskmaster's voice. 

<sup>19</sup> 

The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Why is light [of life] given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul, 

<sup>21</sup> 

Who long and wait for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 

<sup>22</sup> 

Who rejoice exceedingly and are elated when they find the grave? 

<sup>23</sup> 

[Why is the light of day given] to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in? 

<sup>24</sup> 

For my sighing comes before my food, and my groanings are poured out like water. 

<sup>25</sup> 

For the thing which I greatly fear comes upon me, and that of which I am afraid befalls me. 

<sup>26</sup> 

I was not or am not at ease, nor had I or have I rest, nor was I or am I quiet, yet trouble came and still comes [upon me].
