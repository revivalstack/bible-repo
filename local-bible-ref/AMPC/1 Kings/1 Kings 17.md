Elijah the Tishbite, of the temporary residents of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, before Whom I stand, there shall not be dew or rain these years but according to My word. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> 

Go from here and turn east and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, east of the Jordan. 

<sup>4</sup> 

You shall drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there. 

<sup>5</sup> 

So he did according to the word of the Lord; he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, east of the Jordan. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook. 

<sup>7</sup> 

After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And the word of the Lord came to him: 

<sup>9</sup> 

Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So he arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her, Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 

<sup>11</sup> 

As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And she said, As the Lord your God lives, I have not a loaf baked but only a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the bottle. See, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it--and die. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said. But make me a little cake of [it] first and bring it to me, and afterward prepare some for yourself and your son. 

<sup>14</sup> 

For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not waste away or the bottle of oil fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth. 

<sup>15</sup> 

She did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days. 

<sup>16</sup> 

The jar of meal was not spent nor did the bottle of oil fail, according to the word which the Lord spoke through Elijah. 

<sup>17</sup> 

After these things, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. 

<sup>18</sup> 

And she said to Elijah, What have you against me, O man of God? Have you come to me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son? 

<sup>19</sup> 

He said to her, Give me your son. And he took him from her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he stayed and laid him upon his own bed. 

<sup>20</sup> 

And Elijah cried to the Lord and said, O Lord my God, have You brought further calamity upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 

<sup>21</sup> 

And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord and said, O Lord my God, I pray You, let this child's soul come back into him. 

<sup>22</sup> 

And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 

<sup>23</sup> 

And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the [lower part of the] house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, See, your son is alive! 

<sup>24</sup> 

And the woman said to Elijah, By this I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
