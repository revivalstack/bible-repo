Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that he was anointed king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 

<sup>3</sup> 

You know how David my father could not build a house to the Name of the Lord his God because wars were about him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under his feet. 

<sup>4</sup> 

But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil confronting me. 

<sup>5</sup> 

And I purpose to build a house to the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord said to David my father, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house to My Name and Presence. 

<sup>6</sup> 

So, Hiram, command them to hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; my servants shall join yours, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that no one among us can equal the skill of the Sidon men in cutting timber. 

<sup>7</sup> 

When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, Who has given David a wise son to be over this great people. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things for which you sent to me; I will do all you wish concerning the cedar and cypress timber. 

<sup>9</sup> 

My servants shall bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea, make them into rafts, and float them by sea to the place that you direct. I will have them released there, and you shall take them away. And you shall fulfill my desire by providing food for my household. 

<sup>10</sup> 

So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress trees he desired, 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 measures of wheat for food for his household, and 20 measures of pure, beaten oil. He gave these to Hiram yearly. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him; and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they made a treaty. 

<sup>13</sup> 

King Solomon raised a levy [of forced labor] out of all Israel; and the levy was 30,000 men. 

<sup>14</sup> 

He sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month by divisions; one month they were in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was over the levy. 

<sup>15</sup> 

And Solomon had 70,000 burden bearers and 80,000 hewers [of stone] in the hill country of Judah, 

<sup>16</sup> 

Besides Solomon's 3,300 overseers in charge of the people doing the work. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The king commanded, and they hewed and brought out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stone. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the hewing and prepared the timber and stones to build the house.
