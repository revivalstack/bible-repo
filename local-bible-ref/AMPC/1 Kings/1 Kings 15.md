<sup>1</sup> 

In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah (Micaiah) daughter [granddaughter] of Abishalom (Absalom). 

<sup>3</sup> 

He walked in all the sins of his father [Rehoboam] before him; and his heart was not blameless with the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father [forefather]. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Nevertheless, for David's sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem, 

<sup>5</sup> 

Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and turned not aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 

<sup>6</sup> 

There was war between [Abijam's father] Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of [Rehoboam's] life. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David. Asa his son reigned in his stead. 

<sup>9</sup> 

In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Forty-one years he reigned in Jerusalem. His mother was [also named] Maacah (Micaiah) daughter of Abishalom (Absalom). 

<sup>11</sup> 

And Asa did right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father [forefather]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

He put away the sodomites (male cult prostitutes) out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers [Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijam] had made or promoted. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen mother, because she had an image made for [the goddess] Asherah. Asa destroyed her image, burning it by the brook Kidron. 

<sup>14</sup> 

But the high places were not removed. Yet Asa's heart was blameless with the Lord all his days. 

<sup>15</sup> 

He brought the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated into the house of the Lord--silver, gold, and vessels. 

<sup>16</sup> 

There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 

<sup>17</sup> 

Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built up Ramah, that he might allow no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 

<sup>18</sup> 

Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and delivered them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying, 

<sup>19</sup> 

Let there be a league between me and you, as was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me. 

<sup>20</sup> 

So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 

<sup>21</sup> 

When Baasha heard of it, he quit building up Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah--none was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building. And King Asa built up with them Geba of Benjamin, and also Mizpah. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned two years. 

<sup>26</sup> 

He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, with which he made Israel sin. 

<sup>27</sup> 

Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. 

<sup>28</sup> 

In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha slew Nadab and reigned in his stead. 

<sup>29</sup> 

As soon as he was king, Baasha killed all the household of Jeroboam. He left to [it] not one who breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite-- 

<sup>30</sup> 

Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and by which he made Israel to sin, and because of his provocation of the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger. 

<sup>31</sup> 

The rest of Nadab's acts, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? 

<sup>32</sup> 

There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 

<sup>33</sup> 

In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began his reign of twenty-four years over all Israel in Tirzah. 

<sup>34</sup> 

He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin, with which he made Israel sin.
