After this, David smote and subdued the Philistines, and took Gath and its villages out of the hand of the Philistines. 

<sup>2</sup> 

He smote Moab, and the Moabites became David's servants and brought tribute. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Also David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah toward Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 

<sup>4</sup> 

David took from him 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved enough for 100 chariots. 

<sup>5</sup> 

When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians 22,000 men. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Then David put garrisons in Syria, [whose capital was] Damascus; the Syrians became David's servants and brought tribute. Thus the Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went. 

<sup>7</sup> 

David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Likewise from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David brought very much bronze, with which Solomon later made the bronze laver, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze. 

<sup>9</sup> 

When Tou king of Hamath heard how David had defeated all the hosts of Hadadezer king of Zobah, 

<sup>10</sup> 

He sent Hadoram his son to King David to salute him and to congratulate him because he had fought and defeated Hadadezer, for Hadadezer had had wars with Tou. And Hadoram brought with him all manner of vessels of gold, silver, and bronze. 

<sup>11</sup> 

King David dedicated them also to the Lord, with the silver and the gold he brought from all these nations: Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and the Amalekites. 

<sup>12</sup> 

Also Abishai son of Zeruiah slew 18,000 of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 

<sup>13</sup> 

He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the Lord preserved and gave victory to David wherever he went. 

<sup>14</sup> 

So David reigned over all Israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 

<sup>15</sup> 

Joab son of Zeruiah [David's half sister] was over the army; and Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder; 

<sup>16</sup> 

Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were the priests; and Shavsha was secretary [of state]; 

<sup>17</sup> 

Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over [David's bodyguards] the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chiefs next to the king.
