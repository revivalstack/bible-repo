So all Israel was enrolled by genealogies; and they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel. And Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their unfaithfulness to God. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Now the first [of the returned exiles] to dwell again in their possessions in the cities of Israel were the priests, Levites, and the Nethinim [the temple servants]. 

<sup>3</sup> 

In Jerusalem dwelt some of the people of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh: 

<sup>4</sup> 

Uthai son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the sons of Pharez son of Judah. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn and his sons. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their kinsmen, 690. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Of the Benjamites: Sallu son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Ibneiah son of Jeroham; Elah son of Uzzi, the son of Michri; and Meshullam son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah; 

<sup>9</sup> 

And their kinsmen, according to their generations, 956. All these were heads of fathers' houses according to their fathers' houses. 

<sup>10</sup> 

Of the priests: Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jachin; 

<sup>11</sup> 

Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the chief officer of God's house; 

<sup>12</sup> 

And Adaiah son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah; Massai son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; 

<sup>13</sup> 

And their kinsmen, heads of their fathers' houses, 1,760--very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. 

<sup>14</sup> 

Of the Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 

<sup>15</sup> 

And Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; 

<sup>16</sup> 

Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and Berechiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites [near Jerusalem]. 

<sup>17</sup> 

The gatekeepers were: Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their kinsmen, Shallum being the chief 

<sup>18</sup> 

Who hitherto was assigned to the king's east side gate. They were the gatekeepers of the camp of the Levites. 

<sup>19</sup> 

Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his kinsmen of his father's house, the Korahites, were in charge of the work of the service, keepers of the thresholds of the Tent, as their fathers had been in charge of the camp of the Lord, keepers of the entrance. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Phinehas son of Eleazar was ruler over them in times past, and the Lord was with him. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. 

<sup>22</sup> 

All these chosen to be keepers at the thresholds were 212. These were enrolled by their genealogies in their villages [around Jerusalem], these men [whose grandfathers] David and Samuel the seer had established to their office of trust. 

<sup>23</sup> 

So they and their sons had oversight of the gates of the Lord's house, that is, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The gatekeepers were stationed on the four sides [of the house of the Lord]--on the east, west, north, and south. 

<sup>25</sup> 

Their brethren in their villages were to come in every seven days to be with them. 

<sup>26</sup> 

But these Levites, the four chief gatekeepers, were in charge of the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 

<sup>27</sup> 

They lodged round about God's house, for the duty [of watching] was theirs, as well as the opening of the house every morning. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Some of them had charge of the serving utensils, being required to count them when they brought them in or took them out. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Some of them also were appointed over the furniture and over all the sacred utensils, as well as over the fine flour, wine, oil, frankincense, and spices. 

<sup>30</sup> 

Other sons of the priests prepared the ointment of spices. 

<sup>31</sup> 

Mattithiah, one of the Levites, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for the things baked in pans. 

<sup>32</sup> 

Of their Kohathite kinsmen, some were to prepare the showbread every Sabbath. 

<sup>33</sup> 

These are the singers, heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites, dwelling in the temple chambers, free from other service because they were on duty day and night. 

<sup>34</sup> 

These were heads of fathers' houses of the Levites, according to their generations, chief men, who lived in Jerusalem. 

<sup>35</sup> 

In Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife's name was Maacah, 

<sup>36</sup> 

His firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, 

<sup>37</sup> 

Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. 

<sup>38</sup> 

Mikloth was the father of Shimeam. They also dwelt beside their brethren, opposite their kinsmen in Jerusalem. 

<sup>39</sup> 

Ner was the father of Kish, Kish of [King] Saul, Saul of Jonathan, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal. 

<sup>40</sup> 

The son of Jonathan was Merib-baal (Mephibosheth); Merib-baal was the father of Micah. 

<sup>41</sup> 

The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. 

<sup>42</sup> 

Ahaz was the father of Jarah, and Jarah of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; Zimri was the father of Moza, 

<sup>43</sup> 

Moza of Binea; Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 

<sup>44</sup> 

Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sons of Azel.
