The courses or divisions of the priests, the sons of Aaron, were these: The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 

<sup>2</sup> 

But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And David, with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided and distributed them according to their assigned duties. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Since there were more chief men found among the sons of Eleazar [because of the misfortunes of Eli, and Saul's slaughter of the priests at Nob] than among the sons of Ithamar, they were divided thus: sixteen heads of fathers' houses of the sons of Eleazar and eight of the sons of Ithamar according to their fathers' houses. 

<sup>5</sup> 

Thus were they divided by lot, one group with the other, for there were chiefs of the sanctuary and chiefs of God [high priests] drawn both from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Shemaiah the scribe, son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar [the priest who escaped being killed at Nob by Saul and fled to David], and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and Levites--one father's house being taken alternately for Eleazar and one for Ithamar. 

<sup>7</sup> 

The lots fell, the first one to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 

<sup>8</sup> 

The third to Harim, the fourth to Se-orim, 

<sup>9</sup> 

The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 

<sup>10</sup> 

The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 

<sup>11</sup> 

The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 

<sup>12</sup> 

The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 

<sup>13</sup> 

The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebe-ab, 

<sup>14</sup> 

The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 

<sup>15</sup> 

The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, 

<sup>16</sup> 

The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, 

<sup>17</sup> 

The twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul, 

<sup>18</sup> 

The twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. 

<sup>19</sup> 

This was their order for coming on duty to serve in the house of the Lord, according to the procedure ordered for them by their [forefather] Aaron, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded him. 

<sup>20</sup> 

As for the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram: Shubael; of the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah. 

<sup>21</sup> 

Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah: Isshiah the chief. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Of the Izharites: Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath. 

<sup>23</sup> 

The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 

<sup>24</sup> 

The son of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of Micah: Shamir. 

<sup>25</sup> 

The brother of Micah: Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah. 

<sup>26</sup> 

The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. 

<sup>27</sup> 

The sons of Merari: by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. 

<sup>29</sup> 

Of Kish: the son of Kish: Jerahmeel. 

<sup>30</sup> 

The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, according to their fathers' houses. 

<sup>31</sup> 

These likewise cast lots, as did their kinsmen the sons of Aaron, in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers' houses of the priests and Levites--the head of each father's house and his younger brother alike.
