David consulted the captains of thousands and hundreds, even with every leader. 

<sup>2</sup> 

And David said to all the assembly of Israel, If it seems good to you and if it is of the Lord our God, let us send abroad everywhere to our brethren who are left in all the land of Israel, and with them to the priests and Levites in their cities that have suburbs and pasturelands, that they may gather together with us. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for we did not seek it during the days of Saul. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And all the assembly agreed to do so, for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people. 

<sup>5</sup> 

So David gathered all Israel together, from the Shihor, the brook of Egypt [that marked the southeast border of Palestine], to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. 

<sup>6</sup> 

And David and all Israel went up to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim which belonged to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the Lord, which is called by the name of Him Who sits [enthroned] above the cherubim. 

<sup>7</sup> 

And they carried the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio [his brother] drove the cart. 

<sup>8</sup> 

And David and all Israel merrily celebrated before God with all their might, with songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and cymbals and trumpets. 

<sup>9</sup> 

And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to steady the ark, for the oxen [that were drawing the cart] stumbled and were restive. 

<sup>10</sup> 

And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and He smote him because he touched the ark; and there he died before God. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And David was offended because the Lord had broken forth upon Uzza; that place to this day is called Perez-uzza [the breaking forth upon Uzza]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, How can I bring the ark of God home to me? 

<sup>13</sup> 

So David did not bring the ark home to the City of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite [a Levitical porter born in Gath-rimmon]. 

<sup>14</sup> 

And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had.
