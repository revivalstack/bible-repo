David made for himself houses in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. 

<sup>2</sup> 

Then David said, None should carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of God and to minister to Him forever. 

<sup>3</sup> 

And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it. 

<sup>4</sup> 

And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: 

<sup>5</sup> 

Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 kinsmen; 

<sup>6</sup> 

Of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 kinsmen; 

<sup>7</sup> 

Of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 kinsmen; 

<sup>8</sup> 

Of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 kinsmen; 

<sup>9</sup> 

Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 kinsmen; 

<sup>10</sup> 

Of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 kinsmen. 

<sup>11</sup> 

And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites--Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, 

<sup>12</sup> 

And said to them, You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it. 

<sup>13</sup> 

For because you bore it not [as God directed] at the first, the Lord our God broke forth upon us--because we did not seek Him in the way He ordained. 

<sup>14</sup> 

So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel. 

<sup>15</sup> 

The Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses commanded by the word of the Lord. 

<sup>16</sup> 

David told the chief Levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music--harps, lyres, and cymbals--to play loudly and lift up their voices with joy. 

<sup>17</sup> 

So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan son of Kushaiah; 

<sup>18</sup> 

And with them their brethren of the second class: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and also the gatekeepers, Obed-edom and Jeiel. 

<sup>19</sup> 

So the singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound bronze cymbals; 

<sup>20</sup> 

Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps [resembling guitars] set to Alamoth [probably the treble voice]; 

<sup>21</sup> 

Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres set to Sheminith [the bass voice]. 

<sup>22</sup> 

Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in singing, was put in charge of carrying the ark and lifting up song. He instructed about these matters because he was skilled and able. 

<sup>23</sup> 

Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. 

<sup>24</sup> 

Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obed-edom and Jehiah (Jeiel) were also gatekeepers for the ark. 

<sup>25</sup> 

So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. 

<sup>26</sup> 

And when God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord [with a safe start], they offered seven bulls and seven rams. 

<sup>27</sup> 

David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, director of the music of the singers. David also wore an ephod [a priestly upper garment] of linen. 

<sup>28</sup> 

Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, sound of the cornet, trumpets, and cymbals, sounding aloud with harps and lyres. 

<sup>29</sup> 

As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City of David, Michal [David's wife] daughter of Saul, looking from a window, saw King David leaping as in sport, and she despised him in her heart.
