Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to putrefy [and] send forth a vile odor; so does a little folly [in him who is valued for wisdom] outweigh wisdom and honor. 

<sup>2</sup> 

A wise man's heart turns him toward his right hand, but a fool's heart toward his left. 

<sup>3</sup> 

Even when he who is a fool walks along the road, his heart and understanding fail him, and he says of everyone and to everyone that he is a fool. 

<sup>4</sup> 

If the temper of the ruler rises up against you, do not leave your place [or show a resisting spirit]; for gentleness and calmness prevent or put a stop to great offenses. 

<sup>5</sup> 

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler: 

<sup>6</sup> 

Folly is set in great dignity and in high places, and the rich sit in low places. 

<sup>7</sup> 

I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking like slaves on the earth. 

<sup>8</sup> 

He who digs a pit [for others] will fall into it, and whoever breaks through a fence or a [stone] wall, a serpent will bite him. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Whoever removes [landmark] stones or hews out [new ones with similar intent] will be hurt with them, and he who fells trees will be endangered by them. 

<sup>10</sup> 

If the ax is dull and the man does not whet the edge, he must put forth more strength; but wisdom helps him to succeed. 

<sup>11</sup> 

If the serpent bites before it is charmed, then it is no use to call a charmer [and the slanderer is no better than the uncharmed snake]. 

<sup>12</sup> 

The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious and win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him. 

<sup>13</sup> 

The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is wicked madness. 

<sup>14</sup> 

A fool also multiplies words, though no man can tell what will be--and what will happen after he is gone, who can tell him? 

<sup>15</sup> 

The labor of fools wearies every one of them, because [he is so ignorant of the ordinary matters that] he does not even know how to get to town. 

<sup>16</sup> 

Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child or a servant and when your officials feast in the morning! 

<sup>17</sup> 

Happy (fortunate and to be envied) are you, O land, when your king is a free man and of noble birth and character and when your officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness! 

<sup>18</sup> 

Through indolence the rafters [of state affairs] decay and the roof sinks in, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. 

<sup>19</sup> 

[Instead of repairing the breaches, the officials] make a feast for laughter, serve wine to cheer life, and [depend on tax] money to answer for all of it. 

<sup>20</sup> 

Curse not the king, no, not even in your thoughts, and curse not the rich in your bedchamber, for a bird of the air will carry the voice, and a winged creature will tell the matter.
