Then I returned and considered all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun: And I beheld the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they [too] had no comforter. 

<sup>2</sup> 

So I praised and thought more fortunate those who have been long dead than the living, who are still alive. 

<sup>3</sup> 

But better than them both [I thought] is he who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun. 

<sup>4</sup> 

Then I saw that all painful effort in labor and all skill in work comes from man's rivalry with his neighbor. This is also vanity, a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it. 

<sup>5</sup> 

The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh [destroying himself by indolence]. 

<sup>6</sup> 

Better is a handful with quietness than both hands full with painful effort, a vain striving after the wind and a feeding on it. 

<sup>7</sup> 

Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun [in one of its peculiar forms]. 

<sup>8</sup> 

Here is one alone--no one with him; he neither has child nor brother. Yet there is no end to all his labor, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, neither does he ask, For whom do I labor and deprive myself of good? This is also vanity (emptiness, falsity, and futility); yes, it is a painful effort and an unhappy business. 

<sup>9</sup> 

Two are better than one, because they have a good [more satisfying] reward for their labor; 

<sup>10</sup> 

For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! 

<sup>11</sup> 

Again, if two lie down together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone? 

<sup>12</sup> 

And though a man might prevail against him who is alone, two will withstand him. A threefold cord is not quickly broken. 

<sup>13</sup> 

Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to receive counsel (friendly reproof and warning)-- 

<sup>14</sup> 

Even though [the youth] comes out of prison to reign, while the other, born a king, becomes needy. 

<sup>15</sup> 

I saw all the living who walk under the sun with the youth who was to stand up in the king's stead. 

<sup>16</sup> 

There was no end to all the people; he was over all of them. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness, falsity, vainglory) and a striving after the wind and a feeding on it.
